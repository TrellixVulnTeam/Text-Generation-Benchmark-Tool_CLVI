these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born . 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection . by the end of his project , jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection .

new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher .

the timing of the detentions of china 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights . as women 's rights activists , wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens . wu and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor -- `` occupying '' public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women -- that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country .
 jodi arias was sentenced to life in prison monday for the gruesome 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend travis alexander . maricopa county judge sherry stephens could have sentenced arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years , but decided the convicted killer should spend the rest of her life behind bars . because a second jury was deadlocked in the penalty phase of arias ' case , the death penalty was taken off the table , leaving arias ' sentence up to the judge .
that was the message friday from attorney general eric holder to members of the u.s. justice department , which includes the fbi , u.s. marshals service , bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives and other agencies . the directive comes a few weeks after a justice department inspector general report found dea agents in foreign postings attended sex parties with prostitutes paid for by drug cartels , among other indiscretions . justice department employees do n't have a monopoly on such stories : in 2012 , a group of agents and officers in the secret service -- which is part of the department of homeland security -- and officers sent to colombia ahead of president barack obama were relieved of duty and returned home amid allegations of misconduct that involved prostitution .
more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far . `` if hillary clinton ca n't win an election , '' potential female candidates will ask , `` how can i ? '' but men yelling `` iron my shirt '' at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know .
 it 's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer , michael slager , gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named walter scott after a traffic stop in north charleston , south carolina . it 's not supposed to be a mystery : more than 20 years ago , congress approved a law , the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , signed by president bill clinton , that requires the federal justice department to collect data on deaths caused by police . according to section 210402 of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , `` the attorney general shall , through appropriate means , acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers .
present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime , and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment . so then , if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights , can we waive our eighth amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment , even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional ? of course , sterilization wo n't prevent a female sex offender from offending again , no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again .
and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class u.s. territories . as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of america 's island territories are not u.s. citizens would mean adding to `` precedents in our history of which we are least proud . '' those precedents , he warned the court , had been `` repudiated by the american people in the civil war , by three amendments to the constitution of the united states , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization . ''
sure , the islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in islam 's name . we need to show the young dzhokhars that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help . to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young muslims : `` do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ?

on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it . in fact , thanks to apple , we may even see brown santa emojis this december . i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji .
 i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer . if slager had been wearing a body camera , scott would probably still be alive , and slager would n't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence . when we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other south carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver 's license -- it 's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive .
the gains made in the fight against the terror group by iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the u.s. department of defense acknowledges it 's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on `` daily fluctuations in the battle lines . '' cnn asked afzal ashraf , a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq . what this is n't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push .
cnn 's african voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as faarrow combining the translation of their names into english -- iman means `` faith '' and siham means `` arrow '' to talk about music , aspirations and somalia . and we did some research about dadaab refugee camp , it 's a massive camp that has taken in sudanese refugees , somali refugees , rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict . iman : i do n't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we 're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for somalia .
 even in the horror of syria 's civil war , there are few places that showcase the scale of the destruction -- and the senselessness of the loss of life -- more than the yarmouk camp on the outskirts of damascus . two weeks ago isis fighters stormed yarmouk , and that made life for those still inside even worse than it was before . the syrian government responded by unleashing a bombing and shelling campaign on the area , residents told cnn , including barrel bombs that flattened many of the buildings already scarred by the three-year-long conflict .

to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free . taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich , who make their wealth off of their existing wealth , the largely untaxed returns from capital , rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us . in brief , the u.s. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax , with limited taxes on capital what the rich have and limited deductions for most of us .
 former new england patriots star aaron hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of odin lloyd . the suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the july 16 , 2012 , shooting deaths of daniel de abreu and safiro furtado in boston 's south end ; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims ; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm , '' he said . in a lawsuit filed four months later , bradley said hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that hernandez intentionally `` possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have .

 the palestinian authority officially became the 123rd member of the international criminal court on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in palestinian territories . the palestinians signed the icc 's founding rome statute in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed `` in the occupied palestinian territory , including east jerusalem , since june 13 , 2014 . '' `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release .
 governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , amnesty international alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated .
but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine .
 seventy years ago , anne frank died of typhus in a nazi concentration camp at the age of 15 . but new research released by the anne frank house shows that anne and her older sister , margot frank , died at least a month earlier than previously thought . they concluded that anne and margot probably did not survive to march 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by dutch authorities .

walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . the backlash over the religious freedom measures in indiana and arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality .

it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law . progressives may enjoy watching pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. ted cruz of texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the gop table . in fact , according to the american civil liberties union , `` the indiana rfra -lsb- religious freedom restoration act -rsb- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate .

 the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond . despite sharp accusations by some in the united states and its allies , iran denies having such a program , and u.s. intelligence contends that iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon .
