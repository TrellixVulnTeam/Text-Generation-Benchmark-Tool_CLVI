The only thing certain now is uncertainty.The smart money shouts that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs.The smart money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him.
Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months.He urged the president to follow his example and quit, too.But at the White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation are derided as a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation.
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement after appearing 
In the end, the will of the people meant nothing.Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer about that.His mind and the minds of his followers were closed.
Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.But even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's resignation.Rep. Robert Livingston, nominated for speaker last month by his party, startled the House when he announced he would not run for speaker and would resign from the House after 21 years 
The raw passions were such that the House Democrats did not to hesitate to bellow ``You resign!You resign!''at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of certain impeachment.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House.Analysts on both sides of the struggle over President Clinton's future will point to Livingston's downfall as evidence of a generalized breakdown in legislative civility on Capitol Hill.Democrats will see a moral symmetry, depicting Livingston as a victim 
Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton.His previous 24 hours had been his most visible in the month since his party nominated him as speaker and perhaps the most excruciating in his public career: He spent most of the day in a chaotic procedural wrangle over the terms of Friday's debate; he ended it by telling his Republican colleagues that he had had extramarital affairs during his 20-year tenure in Congress.His disclosure followed an investigation 
It has gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessary.You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks, where the guys in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate it?They may have to do that to Washington.
``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that,'' the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, said during Saturday's House debate, in what leaped out as an impossible goal.It would have taken a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture the constantly shifting images competing for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House.The months leading up to the impeachment of President Clinton had become a series of televised anticlimaxes, but 
China's national soccer team could call back four players from overseas to boost its chances at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, an official newspaper reported Monday.Two of the players, Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division.Another, Yang Chen, plays in Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes in France.
Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday.Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin Fahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at least send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.The plea to reconsider was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.
A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led to a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games.India and Pakistan have fought three wars since becoming independent in 1947.A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee that forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes.
In rites building from low flares symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's Olympic-style event.King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-reigning monarch, was upstaged slightly by Japan's Naoko Takahashi.In a marathon run in early morning, to avoid the worst of Bangkok's tropical heat, she won the games' first gold medal in a time just one minute off the world record
Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday.The three horses originally came from Iran, but arrived in Thailand after a training period in the United States.They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games.
Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats.Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team.The games open Dec. 6.
Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees from the 43 nations competing in the December event.Thailand won host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten to move the games to another country.They complained that the Thai organizers were behind in constructing facilities and had failed to keep them informed.
Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press reports that a sports complex would not be completed on time, saying preparations are well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday.Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported.Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from finishing the complex in 
Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday.Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown on panhandlers.About 100 of those detained were displayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok.
For some teams, ``out of bounds'' at the Asian Games means more than just a line on a soccer field or basketball floor.That's because the host city offers the punchy mix of Viagra and notorious night life.The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and ``night life ideas.''
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.According to the officials, White House lawyers conducted a secret review in the months before the attack and concluded that such operations are legal under U.S. and international law.The officials said the raid was timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there with 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400.In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people were killed and 85 were injured, none of 
Sometime in the summer of 1997, an operative for Osama bin Laden sat down at his personal computer in a hideaway in Kenya.He was worried, he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.The organization, the author complained, had declared war against the United States, yet he had learned of that only from the news media.
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years.The government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 
The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland.And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls Enemy No.1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The Associated Press.
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, the neighboring Serbian province.``Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese and Kuwaitis _ they come from several different organizations,'' Klosi 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday.Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or ``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday.They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security, the officer 
MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday.Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, 40, of Sudan, has been jailed since his arrest near Munich on Sept. 16 by Bavarian authorities acting on a U.S. warrant.Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request.
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press 
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials.The evidence, the officials said last week, shows that Salih Idris, the owner of Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, has had financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad, an Egypt-based group responsible for the assassination there of President 
Whether or not the talks between Exxon and Mobil lead to a merger or some other business combination, America's economic history is already being rewritten.In energy as in businesses like financial services, telecommunications and automobiles, global competition and technology have made unthinkable combinations practical, even necessary.Oil companies like Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have an additional pressure, one unthinkable less than two decades ago.
They have been downsized, cut back and re-engineered.So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow.``I think it's a terrible thing,'' said Dick Mabry, a refinery operator, as he emerged in the plant's artificial twilight from the main gate after 
Times are tough in the oil patch.Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing.Oil companies of all stripes are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration.
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.It was unclear Wednesday whether talks were continuing.If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue.

Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.Those divestitures would further reshape an industry already undergoing a broad transformation because of the low price of oil.But the mergers and other corporate combinations are also beginning to create a new regulatory climate among antitrust officials, one that may prove particularly challenging to Exxon and Mobil
It was new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed stocks up.Oil stocks led the way as investors soaked up the news of continuing talks between Exxon and Mobil on a merger that would create the world's largest oil company.Internet and computer stocks also rallied, helped in part by the announcement on Tuesday of America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications in a three-
News that Exxon and Mobil, two giants in the energy patch, were in merger talks last week is the biggest sign yet that corporate marriages are back in vogue.Even before that combination came to light, deal-making was fast and furious.On Monday alone, $40.4 billion in corporate acquisitions were either announced or declared imminent.

The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``the prospects were good'' for completing an agreement.Exxon and Mobil confirmed Friday that they were discussing ways to combine.
British sailor Glyn Charles was missing and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three others remained missing in rough seas after nightfall Monday.Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of Orion on Sunday night.``He has been out there in 10-meter (30-feet) waves and 80-kilometer (50-mile) winds,'' Poke said Monday.
Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.A helicopter rescue team flew to a spot about 50 nautical miles off the far south New South Wales town of Merimbula early Monday morning.Two crew found dead on the stricken 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad were left behind while seven colleagues were winched aboard the helicopter and flown to Merimbula Hospital, he said.
United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday.Sayonara, raced by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison, has only been beaten once since it was launched in 1995 and is aiming for its second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater classic.If the 80-footer beats the local boats home into Hobart, it will be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first.

Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two people who have died in it before,'' said Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray.The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.The two dead were found on the 40-foot (12-meter) vessel Business Post Naiad, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) off the New South Wales town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center in Canberra.Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter, the center said.

Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather.All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast.American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometers (30 miles) offshore while Marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore.

A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it had alerted all shipping in the Strait as high winds and huge seas smash into the remnants of the 115-boat fleet.The Australian Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle into the area Monday morning morning 
He was the classic small-town prodigy, with the creativity of a big-city profiteer.When there was no shot to take, he invented a new one.When there was no one to pass to, he reconfigured the play until a teammate was open.
In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work stoppage in National Basketball Association history, the league Monday announced the cancellation of all 114 preseason games.Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games.While the decision had been expected for 10 days, it nonetheless sent a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order 
In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.If the players win, the owners will be liable for about dlrs 800 million in guaranteed salaries, although they have vowed to appeal if they lose.The league already has sued the players over Feerick's jurisdiction.
Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the players to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor dispute.The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel.The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system 
More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law.But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries.
Patrick Ewing did not want to sound like a striking longshoreman demanding health benefits.``I'm not going to try and put it in dollars and cents.''But Ewing, president of the National Basketball Association Players Association, played the public-relations game Tuesday by expounding on the themes of labor unrest: strong-willed unity and short-sighted proposals.
The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement.Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday.Barring a major compromise, that will not be enough time to preserve a full season and prevent the league from losing its first regular-season games to

As labor battles go, the current one between the National Basketball Association and its players is weird even by sports standards.There is a real possibility that most, if not all, of the coming season will be canceled.In this union battle it is the interests of the best paid, not those who make union scale, that are dominating the discussion.
The National Basketball Association, embroiled in a labor dispute with its players, Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season.It is the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose regular-season games.The NBA's deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, announced the cancellation after nearly three and a half hours of meetings concluded at a Manhattan hotel.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks against the installations.The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little to strengthen security at the embassy.The pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton administration and Congress.
Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.A federal prison official said Monday that the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts of violence and terrorism.''A spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office declined to say whether the authorities foresaw further threats of terrorism.

A federal grand jury in Manhattan returned a 238-count indictment Wednesday charging the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden with conspiring to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August and with committing acts of terrorism against Americans abroad.Government officials immediately announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief military commander.Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban
The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland.And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls Enemy No.1 and blames for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa, Justice Noor Mohammed Saqib said an interview with The Associated Press.
German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday.Police, including agents of an elite anti-terrorist unit, checked several suspects during raids in an industrial zone and other sites Tuesday, but no arrests were made, said Eva Schuebel, spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe.The agency said it had received ``credible information'' that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the 
Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.Wearing gloves and masks, detectives from the Tanzanian Criminal Investigation Division could be seen searching the yard of the house that is surrounded by a high fence.Residents, who were questioned Thursday by Tanzanian police and FBI agents, told reporters Friday there were four regular visitors to the house.
An Islamic militant group on Thursday threatened to retaliate if Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden is arrested, and described Washington's No.1 enemy as a ``hero'' to Muslims worldwide.Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States.
A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane.Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of three defendants in custody in Manhattan.The lawyers complained that their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press 
Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday.Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director.``There is enough rice.
Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country.A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua, near the North Korean border, said the North Koreans were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in China, had formed criminal gangs or engaged in prostitution.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied reports in the South Korean press that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum in forcing 
The founder of South Korea's largest conglomerate plans to visit his native North Korea again next week with a gift of 501 cattle, company officials said Thursday.The visit has been delayed a month because of a dispute over 500 cattle donated by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, during a trip to the North in June.North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them to the North.
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday.The officials warned against international complacency and hostility toward North Korea as the food crisis stretches on and the isolated communist country shows little willingness to adopt far-reaching changes to revive its ruined economy.``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after 
A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said.Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third country'' since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.The ministry generally uses the term ``third country'' to avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defectors to their homeland.
Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday.North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said.Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for this year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi told reporters in 
More than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired, a new study by international aid groups has found.The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country.Among other shocking findings, researchers from the World 
Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North Korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday.Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, communist nation.A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height.
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo on his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken of North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition.Hall also 
Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday.It will be the largest sports delegation the communist country has sent abroad in recent years.North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.Yeltsin was to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going ahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev
President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said.Yeltsin appeared stiff and stumbled during another public ceremony after he arrived in Tashkent, the capital of this Central Asian nation, and had to be supported by Uzbek President Islam Karimov.But the two later held a one-on-one summit as scheduled.
President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.Yeltsin was spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporters.However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term.The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election.It has lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically weaker and has said he will not run again.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday.Government sources said the president has also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were still going forward.Yeltsin has decided to send Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to the November summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum in Kuala Lumpur because it deals mostly with financial issues, Yeltsin's office said.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential decisions'' are needed.
President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday.Asked about small bandages that were visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office said the president had sustained small burns.It did not say what had caused them.
President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday.Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture on this topic.''Still, she noted that he had regular medical check-ups.

Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' orders and quashed rumors he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly at the Kremlin on Wednesday.Still, his appearance didn't silence the growing number of calls for his resignation.Hours after he returned to work, the generally pro-Yeltsin upper house of parliament fell just 11 votes short of passing a motion urging him to step down over his social welfare policies.
What started as a local controversy in Salt Lake City has evolved into a full-blown international scandal.The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe.''
Saying ``if we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch responded on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declaring that IOC members who were found to have accepted bribes from candidate cities could be expelled.``It is a serious problem we have before us,'' Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, said in a hastily arranged news conference at a tumultuous meeting of the IOC executive board.Samaranch compared the current climate to the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the 
Following is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: _ ``The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members _ as well as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions _ any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person.''
LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch on Sunday promised to expel any members if they are found guilty of accepting bribes.Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler.But he said the allegations would be considered by a special IOC panel looking into alleged rules violations by the Salt Lake group which won the 2002 Winter Games.
A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities.Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002.Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment.
Moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders questioned Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation into alleged vote-buying by an Olympic city.Acting with unusual speed, the International Olympic Committee set up a special investigative panel that immediately summoned the organizers of the 2002 Salt Lake Games to address the bribery allegations.The chief investigator refused to rule out the possibility of taking the games away from Salt Lake City _ though that scenario is considered highly unlikely.
The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games.Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada was responding to allegations by Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, of systematic buying and selling of the Olympic Games.``I have never heard of such a thing,'' Tsukada told the Associated Press Sunday.

Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement.Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign.But maybe I will be expelled.
The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been ``muzzled'' by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization.Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news conference.
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday.While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager.NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor 
Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station.The shuttle and its crew of six snared the Russian-made Zarya control module after chasing it around the Earth in ever-closing orbits throughout the day.Less than an hour after a rendezvous 240 miles above the Earth shortly before 6 p.m., Lt. Col. Nancy Currie of the Army deftly used the 50-foot arm to grab 
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.

The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion.After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launch went off flawlessly at 3:36 Friday morning, right on schedule.The night sky was clear, and the moon full.
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.``Amen,'' replied a launch controller.
A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station.Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts is scheduled for Friday at 3:36 a.m.This was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission.The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday.

Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate support for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives.These were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections.
House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights.But the future of the measure was in doubt because it was attached to a spending bill that includes a controversial provision regarding the Federal Election Commission.That provision could scuttle the spending bill, which would finance the Treasury Department and the Postal Service and which still must be approved by the House and Senate.
Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, the most politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.Negotiators ended a late-night session without resolving disagreements over not just education, but the census and contraceptives.These were among the biggest issues that still separated the two sides as each tried to formulate a message to take home to voters for the Nov. 3 elections.
A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with House Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders.On Monday, White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau.The deal would put off until next March 
For the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus.The result was chaos.The lawmakers were never able to agree on a budget resolution _ the framework into which all the tax and spending bills are supposed to fit.
Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in Alaska.The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay.Without the road, its backers say, about 700 residents of King 
Top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline for another day or two.Both sides were amiable as they emerged from a two-hour session, but they had little to report and indicated that their relatively early departure, compared with the last three nights, should not be interpreted as a sign of crisis or of imminent peace in the budget talks.Sunday's discussions focused on education 
Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers.However, no one can vote on the package just yet, because it is not finished.The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document.

Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements and street clashes.Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish a state.``If settlement activity continues, then all means of resistance are open,'' Qureia, who is also known as Abu Ala, told reporters 
The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoided making any threats against him.Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration ``in their back pocket.''``The Palestinians are making a farce out of the Wye River accord.
Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton
Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week.Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs
President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders, the White House said Friday.He is to speak at what the Palestinians are describing as a historic meeting to formally revoke anti-Israel clauses in the 1964 Palestinian charter.Israel demanded revocation of the clauses at U.S.-brokered negotiations last month that led to the latest land-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track.After getting together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later.The president was sure to be asked about the impeachment drama unfolding in Washington.
Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week.U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton during his first visit to Palestinian areas.``There is cooperation with the American security people.
Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''He added that he would not go ahead with a West Bank troop pullback, as promised under the Wye River peace agreement, unless Arafat met a list of demands.
On a street newly littered with the debris of battle _ stones, spent tear gas canisters, charred remnants of half-burned tires _ a sodden Palestinian flag flaps in a fitful rain-laden wind outside a house in mourning.Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, neighbors and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university student felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened to symbolize the bitter occasion.
Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past week, but has hit various snags.Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the two assailants 
Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.The decision came less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem.Two people were killed and 21 others were wounded in the attack for which the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed responsibility.
On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death.Relatives say that the 21-year-old Palestinian from this village near Jerusalem showed no sign that he was heading for a suicide mission with his brother-in-law as part of a secret cell of Islamic Holy War.Their car-bomb blew apart two hours later in a Jerusalem market, killing both 
A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city.``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.''Har Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight.Palestinian officials said they had jailed several of the small but radical group's members from the West Bank, and raided and then shut down a nursery school linked to the organization in Bethlehem, which is controlled by the Palestinians.The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security 
A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21.The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has tried to stop the peace agreement, claimed responsibility, police said.In response to the attack, the Israeli cabinet suspended ratification of the Wye agreement until there ``is verification that the Palestinian authority is indeed fighting terrorism.''
Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism.Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled all of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic militants.The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy.''
A defiant Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that Israel would continue to build Jewish neighborhoods throughout Jerusalem, including at a controversial site in the traditionally Arab sector of the city.``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.''Har Homa is the site of a planned Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, which Palestinians want to have as the capital of their hoped-for independent state.
Blood and soot-blackened water ran in rivulets from the charred wreckage.A burly policeman bent to cover a bloodied corpse with whatever was at hand _ a sodden piece of cardboard, a plastic shopping bag.Two people were killed and at least 21 injured when an explosives-rigged car blew up Friday at Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, only meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing 16 months ago.
A slain Russian lawmaker was honored Tuesday as a martyr to democratic ideals in a stately funeral service in which anger mingled freely with tears.Afterward, Galina Starovoitova was to be buried alongside some of Russia's greatest national heroes.The stirring tribute to Starovoitova, a feisty liberal whose killing remains a mystery, was indicative of the depth of national feeling over her death.
A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city, officials said.Galina Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot dead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday night.The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the country's growing lawlessness.
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said.A neighbor found the body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance, they said.
In modern Russia, the crime was so common as to be mundane.Two thugs, armed with machine pistols and silencers, stalked and killed a powerful figure, then slipped away into the night.Police vowed to catch them and politicians expressed outrage.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian reform movement has produced few leaders with an uncompromising dedication to democracy.Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia.In a bleak season of economic collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence.
Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated.President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment.An aide was also shot and critically wounded.
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with gunshot wounds to the head and neck.The police say the two were attacked in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, one of them a young woman.
The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics.This year, Voinovich, a Republican who is barred from seeking a third term, is running again, this time for the Senate seat held by John Glenn, a Democrat who is retiring.And while there are few who expect Voinovich to repeat his electoral benchmark of four years ago, 
In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said Friday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes, although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities.Clinton has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky, but he has taken to making glancing, at times humble, references to it, before moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans' needs.He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers
It was not a voice mail message that Dr. Marilyn Rymer, a neurologist in Kansas City, Mo., would routinely delete, even as a registered Democrat.``Speaker Newt Gingrich's office,'' it said, was calling to discuss a ``national leadership award.''Dr. Rymer has won acclaim as the director of a prominent stroke-treatment center, but this proposition seemed particularly grand.
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who is running for re-election, went to Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal the other morning to accept an award from mass-transit advocates.But the reporters who had gathered there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator's back.Instead, they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton.
It was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera, one of New York City's most left-leaning labor leaders, was singing the praises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato.Rivera, president of the largest union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children.It looked as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse D'Amato _ or at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S. Senate 
White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer.Publicly, officials in the organization, the Human Rights Campaign, said they were still deliberating their position in the closely watched race, considered among the tightest in the nation.They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday.

In other election years, Reps. David Price and Julia Carson would have had little in common other than that they were Democrats with relatively safe seats.Price is a centrist who has represented this high-tech district in North Carolina for all but 2 of the last 12 years, a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale.Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty.
Nearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted Friday to condemn the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939.The measure, a nonbinding resolution, was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill.He is of Lithuanian descent, has a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the Baltic states' past efforts against Soviet repression.

In the aftermath of last month's deadly sniper attack on an obstetrician in upstate New York, Attorney General Janet Reno announced last week that she was setting up a new investigative unit to examine the possibility that the doctor was the victim of a broader anti-abortion plot.The unit, the National Clinic Violence Task Force, will include a dozen Justice Department lawyers and involve several law-enforcement agencies.But the main work of looking into the shooting of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his suburban Buffalo home and how it fits a 
Federal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning.The man was identified as James Charles Kopp, 44, whose last known address was in St. Albans, Vt. His whereabouts are not known, investigators said.Investigators said Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, 
While veterans and civic leaders devote Wednesday's national holiday to honoring fallen soldiers, Remembrance Day has become a chilling vigil for Canadians in the front lines of the abortion-rights movement.There is immediate fear, because an anti-abortion gunman is believed to be at large.And there is long-term anxiety, because even in this country where abortions are legal and publicly funded, women may find access diminishing.
In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity.And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' 
Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested.She was there before Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town in 1993.She was on the sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices the morning of Oct. 23, about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the clinic doctor, was fatally shot in his home.
On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994.The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James Charles Kopp, who is 
The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated women's access to abortion.That is because the availability of abortion in the Buffalo area, as in much of the United States, is a complex reality, one affected by class and education, medical training and the personal convictions of individual doctors.Knowledgeable middle-class and affluent women here who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy can usually obtain an abortion from their private gynecologists, or 
By outward appearances, Dorothy Hayes' life seems ordinary.She and her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, and every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek before he goes to work.She runs errands, like other suburban moms, and spends much of her day taking care of her children.
Everyone who knew Dr. Barnett Slepian knew that the slight, graying physician endured a measure of stress that would exhaust, even break, most people.There were the strangers who pawed through the garbage cans at his home and growled ``murderer'' as they passed him in the grocery store aisle.Demonstrators assailed his pregnant patients as they arrived at his office for their checkups, calling him a baby killer.
James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics.The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of 
Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize.They were given the prize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system, according to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute.Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.His personal delight was seconded by a burst of public elation in his homeland.Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula.
A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers.``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award.``There have been other Portuguse authors, like Fernando Pessoa, whose work would justify 1,000 Nobels'' Speaking at a packed press coference in Madrid, Saramago joked about how he heard he had won the prize from German air hostess at 
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar and Blimunda.''
There's room for a few more names on a 20th century honor roll of writers, and one will be added this week when the Swedish Academy announces the latest Nobel Literature laureate.Who is chosen and why stimulates animated conversation with readers as well as academics, critics and the authors themselves.This year's winner _ or, possibly, winners _ will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday.
Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.A tall, balding man whose large, tinted glasses often give him a mien of severity, Saramago is the first Portuguese-language writer _ and one of the first card-carrying Communists _ to become a Nobel Literature laureate
When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters.Questions about the prize have engaged and piqued the literary world ever since.A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writers.
Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence.The prestigious prize went to Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad.Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for nominations.That prize was shared by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin for signing the Camp David peace accords.However, the five-member Norwegian awards committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering the pact, only to be foiled by their own rules.
Three American pharmacologists were awarded the Nobel Prize on Monday for their surprising discoveries of how natural production of a gas, nitric oxide, can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions.Those include widening blood vessels, helping to regulate blood pressure, initiating erections, battling infections, preventing formation of blood clots and acting as a signal molecule in the nervous system.The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, 
His friend and political mentor is jailed, robbing their budding opposition political party of its most potent organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not afraid.A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies ready at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away.He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group.Qin said a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activities.
The trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year.In his second hard-line speech in six days, Jiang vowed to crush any challenges to Communist Party rule and preserve social stability.He demanded that officials ``talk politics'' _ a euphemism for following party orders.
Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences.Critics of China on Capitol Hill and human rights groups said the tough prison terms were evidence of the failure of the administration's policy of encouraging trade and diplomatic ties with China in hopes of democratic reform.The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday to 13 
Trying to deflect foreign criticism of a crackdown on democracy campaigners, China sent a respected labor rights activist from jail into U.S. exile Sunday even as it prepared to put a prominent dissident on trial.Xu Wenli's trial Monday and his almost certain conviction would deprive a nascent opposition political party of a potent organizer and a moderate voice.He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.
In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political party.The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years.His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days after his trial.
By sentencing two of the country's most prominent democracy campaigners to long prison terms, China on Monday took its harshest steps yet in its current crackdown on organized political opposition.After a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for ``subversion of state power.''Xu's alleged crimes included helping to organize a new political party, calling for an end to 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed.``The reaction of Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed

China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the United States.Releasing Liu Nianchun appeared to be an attempt by the government to blunt international criticism over Monday's upcoming trial of prominent dissident Xu Wenli.Xu is the third leading member of a would-be opposition political party put on trial for subversion in a three-week crackdown that has seen at least 32 dissidents arrested or interrogated.
The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy.In her first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate.``We have heard a lot of talk in recent days about printing new money, indexing 
If the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been planning for months _ millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years.But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the country and its economy the question is what the marchers will be demonstrating against.President Boris Yeltsin and his economic advisers were easy targets two months ago.
Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks.Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month.They must consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect under the constitution.
In a season of crashing banks, plunging rubles, bouncing paychecks, failing cropsand rotating governments, maybe it is not the ultimate insult.But the nation that bore Tolstoy and Chekhov, and still regards a well-written letter as a labor of love, is buckling a little this week, because it can no longer wish good health to Baba Anya in Omsk.The Post Office is broke.
When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing _ at least for the moment _ a nasty financial brush fire in Asia.In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 _ a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity.Talk about bad market calls.
Wall Street extended a global stock selloff Thursday with the Dow industrials tumbling more than 200 points for a second straight day.The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 points on Wednesday, fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close at 7,632.53.Broader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading.
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman said Friday.``The president clearly understands that such a ban would be a clear violation of our rights ... that would mean a return to the Iron Curtain in everyday life,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushin.The remarks came after media reports of a government economic plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, and 
President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for ``corrections'' to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledged that reforms would continue.Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian economists, saying only that the changes were necessary because of the country's economic problems.Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax news agency reported.
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing state property.``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of Western businessmen.``We shall conduct privatization so that it serves the interests of the people, the state, and business,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday.After two weeks of deliberations he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis.``I want to repeat once more _ there is no program,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim.Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada.``They expressed their concern about what's happening and the statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told radio station DZXL in Manila.
After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim.Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the meeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month in the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar.The former deputy prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept. 20 on corruption and illegal sex charges, then brought to court with a black 
A group of high-powered U.S. investors in Southeast Asia on Monday applauded efforts to perk up Thailand's staggering economy, saying they had been assured by top Thai officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved.After meetings with Thai Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said they were confident in the future of Thailand's economy and promised their companies would continue to invest here and elsewhere in the region.``We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform 
The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system.Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any time.But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly.
In little more than a week, the world's leaders will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of Southeast Asia for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.They could hardly be meeting in a more provocative place.On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency, the ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in its stock and currency markets, particularly on investment from overseas.
Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to restore stability.Among the necessary steps is for countries to restructure their economies and corporations to make them less susceptible to abuse by narrow political interests, the officials suggested.The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote regional economic stability.
Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said.Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an 
The last time the Asia-Pacific region held its annual summit to promote free trade, Japan's prime minister assured everyone that his economy wouldn't be the next victim of Asia's financial crisis.Canada, the host country, was criticized by some in Canada for cracking down on demonstrations against Suharto, Indonesia's iron-fisted ruler at the time.And President Bill Clinton, whose popularity and booming economy were the envy of the planet, joined everyone else in urging countries such as Thailand and South Korea to bite the 
The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit.It's expected to be a hot affair.
Indonesian President B.J.Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday.Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting.
Last Saturday morning, while Matthew Shepard lay comatose from a beating, a college homecoming parade passed a few blocks from his hospital bed in Fort Collins.Propped on a fraternity float was a straw-haired scarecrow, labeled in black spray paint: ``I'm Gay.''Few people missed the message.
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev.Anne Kitch, said in a homily that was carried beyond the packed pews of St. Mark's Episcopal Church, through a filled parish hall, across the street to a packed Presbyterian 
At first, the passing bicyclist thought the crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow.But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier.On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in a coma in critical condition.

Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming

On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington.It was the latest salvo in a six-month campaign by the religious right, with the tacit, even explicit, approval of Republican leaders, to demonize gay people for political gain in this election year.This particular press conference 
As a gay college student lay hospitalized in critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city, which bills itself as ``Wyoming's hometown,'' wrestled with its attitudes towards gay men.On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, ``Pistol Pete'' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger group of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffered severe head injuries in the attack last 
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua.That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, Bolanos said.
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities.At least 32 people were killed and widespread flooding prompted more than 150,000 to seek higher ground.Mitch, once among the century's most powerful hurricanes, weakened today as it blasted this Central American nation, bringing downpours that flooded at least 50 rivers.
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America.EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential rains and mudslides.The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly 
Better information from Honduras' ravaged countryside enabled officials to lower the confirmed death toll from Hurricane Mitch from 7,000 to about 6,100 on Thursday, but leaders insisted the need for help was growing.President Carlos Flores declared Hurricane Mitch had set back Honduras' development by 50 years.He urged the more than 1.5 million Hondurans affected by the storm to help with the recovery effort.
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area.It also was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.President Carlos Flores Facusse declared a state of maximum alert and the Honduran military sent planes to pluck residents from their homes on islands near the coast.At 0900 GMT Tuesday, Mitch was 95 miles (152 kilometers) north of Honduras, near the Swan Islands.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies have been overwhelmed.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs
In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes.Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday.
Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people.Foreign aid and pledges of assistance poured into Central America, but damage to roads and bridges reduced the amount of supplies reaching hundreds of isolated communities to a trickle: only as much as could be dropped from a helicopter, when the aircraft can get through.In the Aguan River Valley in northern Honduras, floodwaters have receded, leaving a 
Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election.The soul-searching and recriminations _ and a possibility of congressional leadership challenges _ came as election results showed that Republicans had been unable to increase their 55-45 hold over the Senate and that Democrats had picked up five seats in the House.The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president
Just four years ago, it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would be the pivotal figure in U.S. politics at the turn of the millennium.Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority.With a promise to balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social values, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress just as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency.
The presidential campaign of 2000 began Wednesday, like it or not.The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn by the voters in Tuesday's elections, which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats.President Clinton called it an ``astonishing'' triumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won so many major victories ``because they had a clear message.''

House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections.Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January.``This will give us a chance to purge some 
A struggle for control of the House is under way, with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich as speaker.But Gingrich's counter-campaign has given some members pause about ousting him.At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knots for months.

This is what Newt Gingrich is supposed to do well.The planning.The strategy.
A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled.Not only that, but Carville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the Republicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leaders in his own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before Election Day.``My sense of frustration is that I believe the Democrats have a much 
A panel investigating apartheid-era atrocities said Wednesday it will not implicate the last apartheid president, F.W.de Klerk, in human rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge.De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday.
A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday.The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday.
Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W.de Klerk, in illegal acts.De Klerk, 62, who helped negotiate the end of South Africa's white supremacist government and shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize with President Nelson Mandela for that work, had objected to a finding by the commission that he was ``an accessory after the fact'' in the bombings of the 
Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday.Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society.``We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past that any such commission has yet produced.Drawing from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.It has fulfilled its mandate 
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South Africa.The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during apartheid.Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, the report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid.
Criminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against white rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor said Monday.Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters.They include two unnamed generals in the apartheid state's security apparatus, President Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and officials of the African National Congress, he said.
Following are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies.Moreover, the South African state in the period from the late 1970's to early 1990's became involved in activities of a criminal nature when, amongst other things, it knowingly planned, 
The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free.If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted.After more than two years of hearings into apartheid-era atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a 3,500-page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty.
The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it struggled to overcome white rule.The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings.South African media released preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital.
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported.Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent 
After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too distant future.''Annan's comments came Saturday after he and Gadhafi failed to agree on handing over Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are suspected in the 1988 bombing that killed 270 people.On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed in a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister in a tent.Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie case,'' the television said

Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday he was extending his North African tour to include talks with Libyan authorities.The remark was made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers hours before his arrival in Tunis, his final scheduled stop on a tour aimed at unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the disputed Western Sahara.During his visit to Tunis, Annan is to meet with authorities here to discuss ``major regional and international issues and the various initiatives aimed at solving unresolved problems,'' according to the local press.
Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial.``We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without a political or security background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said.He was addressing the General People's Congress, or Parliament, which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who are wanted in connection 
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspects.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday, his first known trip since injuring his hip in July.Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived by land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest'' at the invitation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an official statement said.Tunisian television did not show the Libyan leader but said he met with Ben Ali and several government ministers in a desert oasis at Tozeur, 400 kms (240 miles) south of 
With the mournful lament of bagpipes and prayers of healing, the people of Lockerbie paid tribute to the 270 people killed when a bomb brought Pan Am Flight 103 crashing down on this tiny town 10 years ago Monday.The hundreds who packed Dryfesdale Parish Church heard messages from British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton, who renewed their vows to punish the culprits who hid the bomb in a suitcase on Dec. 21, 1988.But they also heard quiet sobs that echoed throughout the century-old church as a few moments of 
Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial system.The draft declaration said recent financial market turmoil shows that adjustments must be made quickly ``to keep the difficulties affecting a few from becoming a crisis for all.''The declaration addresses the world's seven richest nations.
The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion.That is the widest gap since the government recalculated the way it measures trade flows in 1992.It resulted from a decline in American exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys from abroad.
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's efforts to repair the largest economy in Latin America may depend on the outcome of this weekend's gubernatorial elections.Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence.But his plan, expected to be unveiled next week, must be approved by Congress, and state governors have enormous sway over local delegations.
There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers.No haircuts or phone calls, either.Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital.
Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global financial crisis.Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's developing economies.An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue facing the world at the moment.
The United States is preparing to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign officials assembling the program.Details of the U.S. contribution, which is expected to total several billion dollars in direct aid or loan guarantees, have yet to be negotiated.But several congressional leaders have been alerted to the likelihood that the administration would 
Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus.So they're considering paying with products instead of cash.Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of Brazil's largest federation of trade unions.
Brazilian officials ended four days of meetings with representatives of the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday without living up to their public pledge to announce concrete measures to reduce government deficits.In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years.With only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in Brasilia, said how the government planned to achieve the savings.

Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy.A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000.The statement was issued after weekend talks between IMF officials and a Brazilian delegation headed by Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Finance Ministry.
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government.``The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people,'' Sihanouk wrote.
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls illegal.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members' return an international issue.Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition _ claiming widespread intimidation and 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim, the current 
Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body.Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse.
Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. Congress with a lengthy defense of strongman Hun Sen's human rights record.The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations.A 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.Hun Sen and Ranariddh, co-prime ministers in a coalition formed in 1993 after a landmark U.N.-sponsored election, often clashed over power-sharing and the integration of guerrilla fighters from the crumbling Khmer Rouge.Their arguments turned bloody last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a coup.
Cambodian leader Hun Sen has guaranteed the safety and political freedom of all politicians, trying to ease the fears of his rivals that they will be arrested or killed if they return to the country.The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life.Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have been holed 
King Norodom Sihanouk has declined requests to chair a summit of Cambodia's top political leaders, saying the meeting would not bring any progress in deadlocked negotiations to form a government.Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling party and the two-party opposition had called on the monarch to lead top-level talks, but disagreed on its location.``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Hun Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' safety and their right to conduct political activities 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' the political crisis.Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely 
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post.Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23.Although a boycott by Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party will hardly spoil the chances of Gen. Emile Lahoud, it could embolden others to express discontent at the 
The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon.``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir.Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, said Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with the new president.He accused President Emile Lahoud of violating the constitution and demanded that he acknowledge it before he could reconsider his position.Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect Lebanon's economic recovery.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud.Hariri is still the front-runner to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted sources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud Friday.According to the constitution, a president must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet 
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.

Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as president.Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the main power broker in the country, making the election by Lebanon's pro-Syrian Parliament later this week just a formality.A total of 113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula.President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged that his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question.He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility 
President Clinton made an unusual, direct appeal to North Korea on Saturday to set aside any nuclear ambitions in favor of strengthening ties to South Korea and the United States.The appeal came during a meeting with reporters at which he also counseled patience over Iraq's refusal to comply with a request from weapons inspectors.``I think it's important that we not overreact here on the first day,'' Clinton said in response to reports that Iraq had balked at a request by U.N. inspectors for documents on its weapons program.

A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared.Without naming his source, Rep. Kim Deog-ryong of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee said he had ``information'' that two underground facilities captured on U.S. spy satellite photos may be nuclear plants.He said in a Parliament session that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004.

North Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspections comes to blows.The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported that North Korean soldiers and people of all walks of life were ``on full alert for war.''North Korea typically sends out belligerent rhetoric, especially when it enters high-stake talks with Washington.
North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, the State Department said on Wednesday.The delegation, led by Charles Kartman, will press for access to the site, which American intelligence agencies believe could be the centerpiece of an effort to revive a frozen nuclear arms program.``We've made clear to the North Koreans that any attempt by North Korea to pursue a nuclear weapons development program would be unacceptable,'' 
North Korea has demanded that the United States pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials said Wednesday.The United States rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government delegation.``As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue of compensation, and we flatly rejected it,'' said State Department Spokesman James Rubin.
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.The congressman, Tony Hall, D-Ohio, who has had a longtime interest in world hunger, passed through Tokyo on his return to the United States and showed photographs he had taken of North Korean children with patchy hair, protruding bones, open sores and other signs of severe malnutrition.Hall also 
In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed in South Korea.He promoted a private, sang birthday greetings to a sergeant major and described the threats to his hopes for peaceful engagement with North Korea.``Lately, signs of danger have intensified,'' Clinton said in an address to airmen here, standing before a gunmetal gray F-16 and A-10 parked nose-to-nose.

The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail trial.The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic messages.The human testimony often pales next to the e-mail evidence.
America Online built itself into the most potent force in cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers who want to flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores.Now, the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits.Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: 
Stock prices vaulted to record levels Monday, furthering a recovery that as recently as two months ago seemed nearly unthinkable.``I thought we were in the most serious correction since 1990, but I never thought or wrote that the bull market was over,'' said Byron Wien, U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. ``Now it seems all of that is behind us.''The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27.

The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields.But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software.The department has presented solid evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in

Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.An Egypt Air plane was the first to land on the desert tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip at 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt).But the emotional highlight was the touchdown of the first Palestinian Airlines plane, a Fokker 50.
Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the fledgling Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: its own airport.As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday.The airport has been nearly completed for months.
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process.Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni.``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he told 
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.A plane bound for Amman, Jordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand that Palestinian officials inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio reported.The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his luggage.

The control tower is still without controls, the check-in counter has no computers and the runway can't function after dark for lack of flood lights.Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International Airport is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and a lot of patriotic pride.``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border
The first Palestinian commercial flight landed at Amman's Marka Airport on Saturday, inaugurating an air route between Jordan and the autonomous Gaza Strip.The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly Palestinian businessmen and students.The plane will return later in the day.
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.In a similar vein, Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman Joaquin Perez said Wednesday: ``The government should not have any opinion about the extradition.''
The Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank accounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman said Wednesday.Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.But government spokesman Achille Casanova said no accounts have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation order has been given to federal banking authorities.
Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission President Jacques Santer said.Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.``There is a climate of division, confrontation and instability in Chile,'' parliamentary deputy Alberto Espina told reporters in Madrid after meeting the Chilean ambassador.Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.''``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday.Castro had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back surgery.'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, very, very, ill.'' Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder which 
As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.In London, where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen.They also maintained that as a former head of state, the general had diplomatic immunity 
The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities and they will not interfere.``Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar.``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so.''
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.Chilean officials, meanwhile, issued strong protests and sent a delegation to London on Sunday to argue for Pinochet's release.The former strongman's son vowed to hire top attorneys to defend his 82-year-old father, who ruled Chile with an iron fist for 17 years.
Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move.Pinochet, who has vowed to fight attempts to extradite him to Spain on allegations of murder, genocide and torture, had drinks with Lady Thatcher and her husband, Denis, in their home in London's elite Belgravia district four days before he was hospitalized for back surgery performed Oct. 9.``She 
The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power.The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament.Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday.
Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in parliament, votes against him.The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign.
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said to be extremely slim.If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.
A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government.Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament.He also suggested that although Parliament has set April 18 as the date for a new election, he might seek to remain in power for 
After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate to the Turkish president.In a statement reported by the Anatolia news agency, Ecevit said he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning.Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles.The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez.News reports said Virtue was holding out for a number of Cabinet seats that reflected its standing as the largest party in parliament.
Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home.The invasion, after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece, has led to the division of the island.Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots 
ANKARA, Turkey (AP) - Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Wednesday faced intense pressure to step down after allegations that he interfered in a privatization contract and helped a businessman linked to a mobster secure loans.Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure the government.
President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition.Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament.``It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel.
Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition.Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party.Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already has the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal.
Hours after Darryl Strawberry was released from Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Friday, he spoke happily about being able to play with his two young children, joked about eating a small amount of chicken and potatoes and sounded relieved to be at home in Fort Lee, N.J., instead of in a hospital.``I'm really feeling good,'' said Strawberry, in a telephone interview.``It's nice to be home with the kids and to just kick back.
Chuck Knoblauch and Tino Martinez were as popular as squeegee men a week ago, the speculation rampant that one or the other or both might be exiled if the Yankees' historic year crumbled in the post-season.Two big hits in the midst of a big inning changed all that Saturday night in Game 1 of the World Series.The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed 
Talk about high expectations.It's not just the man from Tampa who has them anymore.Knowing their baseball as well as they do, everybody in the Joe Torre family passed up tickets for the divisional series and the league championship series as just so much parsley on the plate of life.
YANKEES Pitching The starting pitching enabled the Yankees to advance past Cleveland in the American League Championship Series.David Wells is 7-1 in his career in the postseason and he should have an additional edge against a Padres' lineup that is generally less effective against left-handed pitching.Orlando Hernandez has four terrific pitches, pitched seven shutout innings in the pivotal Game 4 of the ALCS and earned the start in Game 2 of this series.
The moment of truth for Chuck Knoblauch came in the bottom of the first inning when his name was announced at Yankee Stadium for the first time since he neglected to chase down that memorable loose ball last Wednesday.There were no boos.It was a very warm ovation.
As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he wants to do it with a free mind.Free of worrying about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made this post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing.But it is not easy to keep the mind uncluttered.
A strong sign that this city is going bonkers for the Padres came Friday morning when 680 fans agreed to shave their heads for a radio promotion raffle in return for a 1-in-680 chance at skybox tickets for post-season play.``This was more a show of support for the team than it was for the one ticket,'' said Tommy Sablan, producer of the ``Jeff and Jer'' show.``It was symbolic of the efforts of the bald Padres _ Tony Gwynn, Wally Joyner, Greg Vaughn, Jim Leyritz.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport.Bedecked in bunting and banners, the revered ballpark always elevates the game with its aura of history and accomplishment.That makes it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or 
The last time they were seen on the field at Yankee Stadium, they were inadvertently influencing the outcome of the game that sent the Cleveland Indians home and the Yankees to the World Series.That's not to say the umpires will mess up in the World Series, but they have shown they are eminently capable of interfering with the natural progression of postseason games.All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both 
A new shipment of bats arrived for Tino Martinez on Friday, and he massaged the handles to make sure they were thin enough, knocked on the barrels and listened for a certain sound and swung them slowly again and again.Martinez was so excited about the fresh bats, he reacted like a Little Leaguer who was wielding an aluminum bat for the first time.``You were saving the World Series trees until now, right?''
Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this week after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic.Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards.
Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday.The meeting was the first international debate in Yugoslavia over the U.N. tribunal's work and the government's cooperation with it.The tribunal, established by the U.N. Security Council in 1993, sits in The Hague, Netherlands.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.Prosecutor Grant Niemann said he would appeal Delalic's acquittal, and asked judges to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the appeal.
American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment.Maj. Gen. Radislav Krstic, arrested without incident in the American sector in northeast Bosnia, is the highest-ranking official to be seized so far, and the first serving military officer.He is accused of directing the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, one of the most chilling and influential events of the Bosnian war, when some 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men were marched off
In its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's civil war, a U.N. war crimes tribunal on Monday convicted three prison officials and guards, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw the facility.The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Cmndr.Zejnil Delalic, of the Bosnian Muslim Army, of responsibility for war crimes committed at a government-run prison camp under his overall command.

The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo.In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.''``The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,
Some of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred near this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor.Piecing together what happened, from surviving family members, ethnic Albanian separatist forces and official Serbian information, a story emerges of fierce guerrilla resistance to an onslaught by Serbian tanks, artillery 
To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.''Opening a genocide trial Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutor Terree Bowers said the 30-year-old mechanic used the nickname Adolf ``with a perverse pride in the genocidal symbolism it represented.''Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992.
He called himself the ``Serb Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling as his nickname.In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious offense.The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence.
A senior Palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative.``It is time to deliver,'' Saeb Erekat told reporters Sunday night after a meeting of the Palestinian Cabinet.Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with Israel.
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, is being considered for the government's No.2 post.
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.

Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer.But for more than three decades his role in Israeli public life has been that of an unapologetic warrior, first on the battlefield and later in the bare-knuckled combat of domestic partisan politics.With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor, Sharon at 70 is to his many critics here a caricature of right-wing intransigence.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed.Unfortunately, he is also capable of wrecking the entire peace effort.

Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian officials were not immediately available for comment.The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
Protesters on Sunday urged Australian military leaders to identify Indonesian army officers trained here to allow closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor.The Australian military holds joint training exercises with Indonesian troops, including the elite commando units accused ot atrocities in East Timor.In Queensland, about 100 activists gathered outside the Canungra Land Warfare Center, south of Brisbane, to mark the 23rd anniversary of the Indonesian invasion of East Timor.
In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975.``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end summit.Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday blamed ``administrative negligence'' for an incident in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta was left stranded at the airport for hours after being refused entry.Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was politically motivated.Ramos-Horta is an advocate of independence for Indonesian-controlled East Timor, and newspapers reported Taiwan had formerly barred him to avoid antagonizing Indonesia.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an Indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers.Sent to make peace in Indonesian-controlled East Timor, Jamsheed Marker's recent hasty departure from the troubled territory signaled how easily tensions there can boil over.Yet Marker, who is visiting Indonesia to promote a U.N.-designed blueprint for autonomy in the former Portuguese colony, said Monday that both sides in the bitter conflict were displaying a newfound taste

Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory.Foreign Minister Ali Alatas questioned whether Portugal truly wanted to settle the problem of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, the official Antara news agency reported.Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.
Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.A rampaging crowd also burned down a market and a Muslim school.Troops and riot police patrolled the streets.

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Friday expressed its ``deep concern'' over reports of physical abuse of Malaysia's former deputy-prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, who was arrested last month.``The EU urges the Malaysian authorities to ensure that similar incidents will not occur again in the future and that Anwar Ibrahim be assured correct treatment while in custody,'' a statement by the 15 EU countries said.The EU ``hopes that appropriate action will be taken against any individuals, including officials, found responsible for such 
Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of Malaysian police.After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday.``We can't accept this and we will undertake full investigations,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Thursday's New Straits Times.
Among Asia's leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was notable as a man with a bold vision: a physical and social transformation that would push this nation into the forefront of world affairs.It almost came true.In 17 years as prime minister, Mahathir, 72, who is a medical doctor, fostered an economic liberalization that led to some of the world's fastest rates of growth.
The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system.Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, said last week he could ``drop dead'' at any time.But because of the large number of candidates for the deputy's job within the ruling United Malays National Organization, a decision was not expected quickly.
Lawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went to court Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite detention.Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas corpus appeal that says the dissident politician is being unjustly held.She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband, and asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?''
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.The man need not necessarily be very religious and only preoccupied with doing virtuous deeds at all times, the national news agency, Bernama, quoted Mahathir as saying after Friday prayers at the Al-Falah Mosque in the northern town of Jitra in Kedah state.``It is sufficient that the person does things acceptable by the people,'' Mahathir said.
The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
Deprived of a voice in state-controlled newspapers and television, supporters of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the Internet to air their views.Although the government said police would ``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is ``impossible to control.''Jailed, beaten and facing trial on 10 sexual misconduct and corruption charges, ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is a political underdog in Malaysia.
A key witness in the government's sexual misconduct case against Malaysia's former deputy prime minister remains determined to appeal his conviction, his attorney said Monday.Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident.Anwar has said the guilty plea was coerced.

One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British spies.The tape was played by Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov at a news conference in Grozny.He refused to answer questions about it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government had it.

A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, was seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus.
A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency said.In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security officials.Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to five people are hospitalized every week with injuries from mine explosions, Interfax reported.
Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday.Mansur Tagirov vanished Thursday evening while returning to Chechnya's capital city Grozny from a small village nearby, news reports said.Officials at the prosecutor's office said unidentified attackers seized Tagirov, and authorities speculated it was the work of an armed band seeking the release of one of its members from prison.

Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them.The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from Russian and foreign officials.Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander.

The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister.In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless killing of the four hostages.''Van den Broek said the EU was determined to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed.
Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia.An Associated Press reporter saw the severed heads near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Grozny, the Chechen capital.He did not see any sign of the bodies.
The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action soon to end the humanitarian crisis in the southern Serbian province.Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo.A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say.Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other hand is treated as key to peace in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention.Russia stepped 
With NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered an 11th-hour warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes.But there was no sign that Slobodan Milosevic was backing down.Following his meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's office issued a statement denouncing NATO threats as a ``criminal act'' which favored separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo.In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.But Annan said he did not ``have the means necessary to provide an independent assessment of compliance as required by the Security Council'' and suggested 
The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack.Milosevic was also told, the diplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home.Most of these refugees are reluctant to return because many of the Serb police officers 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago.Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation'' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday.Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province.Fearing airstrikes, Yugoslav generals put the nation's air defense on high alert, but tried a belated compromise by moving some tanks and other heavy equipment out of Kosovo.A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.

Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence.Ten of the 11 countries joining European economic union dropped their key interest rate to 3 percent, with Portugal making the most significant plunge, from 3.75 percent.Austria made the smallest cut, from 3.2 percent.
Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European Union members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should take part, according to a poll published Tuesday.The survey by the Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that.The remaining 10 percent were undecided.
In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1.Ten of the 11 countries adopting the euro dropped their interest rate to 3 percent.Italy dropped to 3.5 percent from 4 percent.
Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the precursor of a pan-European market.The Bourse in Paris also announced that it would play host to a meeting Nov. 27 of nine other European exchanges to discuss ``the steps and conditions needed to create a unifying and competitive pan-European equity market.''The two announcements show how 
The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday.The fall continued the steady decline of inflation in the euro-zone over the past year.Annual inflation stood at 1 percent in October and 1.6 percent in November 1997, according to Eurostat's monthly report.
Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean.The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' French 
Palm Pilot in one hand, cellular phone in the other, Jean-Marc Routiers, 26, was juggling business calls halfway between London and Paris.When his phone went dead as the high-speed Eurostar train pulled into the underwater tunnel that links England to the Continent, the London-based French banker loosened his Italian silk tie and introduced himself.``I definitely describe myself as a European,'' he said in the fluent English he perfected working at an Australian bank.
China made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization for the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealings starting Jan. 1.The expected announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro accounts.``Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January 1, 1999,'' Xinhua reported.
Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed.``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question.The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the job.
In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1.Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation in the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy.He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone
Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally.The address to Parliament was expected Wednesday, followed perhaps by Friday by the vote of confidence that will determine whether Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old, center-left alliance stands or falls.Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for 
It is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems could the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came undone Sunday.The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.Officials in the prime minister's office said Sunday night that Prodi would 
By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and was toppled from power.The collapse of his government after two and a half years, the second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the chronic political instability that marked Italy for decades had sprung back to life.Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain in charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is formed.
By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies.Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.The vote, 3rd graf prv
By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.
Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments.Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support.The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber.
Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque feuds and shifting alliances.And that time-honored tradition may have won the embattled government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a momentary reprieve.A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority in Parliament.

Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week.``We must respect the will of the voters.If we win the confidence vote, we will go ahead, otherwise we will pass the baton,'' Prodi told a news conference closing a two-day French-Italian summit in Florence.
Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government.Following the talks, which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority.He could also name a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats.
Microsoft Corp. has said that material in an unpublished book by two business school professors will be a crucial part of its defense in the antitrust trial scheduled to begin next week.But judging from an advance copy of the manuscript, the Justice Department and 20 states that are suing the software giant will find support for their arguments in the book as well.To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product.
The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments.Whatever the outcome of the trial, scheduled to begin Monday in U.S. District Court in Washington, an almost certain appeal will leave to the Supreme Court the task of bringing legal order to 100 years of clashing antitrust doctrines.The case focuses on 
In the summer of 1995, a whiff of revolution was in the air in Silicon Valley.The Internet offered a new deal in computing, a fresh opportunity for entrepreneurs to try to break Microsoft Corp.'s firm grip on the personal computer software business.Leading the challenge was Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom.
The legal tool that the government is using in its assault on Microsoft Corp. _ the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 _ is brief, vague and malleable.The combination has meant that this bedrock statute of antitrust policy has been at turns toothless and powerful over the years, depending on the politics and economics of the day as interpreted by the courts.Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash

Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive.The executive recalls telling Klein that unless a case went beyond the Internet browser market, it would have little effect on Microsoft's power to stifle competition across the computer industry.Klein replied that he understood the computer executive's concerns.
The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators.But it has by no means been an example of consistent, coordinated public policy.Nor, by all accounts, of politics.
Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as passed by Congress in 1890.As the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it.In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties
A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial records.Microsoft argued that allowing ``an army of government attorneys to come in and make demands will make it very difficult for us to remain in business.''But after winning assurances from government lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches of the records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for 
Will it matter to consumers that Bill Gates isn't a nice guy?Until last week, most Americans thought of Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corp., as a genius and innovator.A nerd perhaps _ but also a self-styled visionary who almost single-handedly unlocked the power of the personal computer.
Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey.Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest was announced Friday.``We do not give advise to other countries,'' said parliament speaker Apostolos Kaklamanis.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.''Kurds in Italy, Germany, Austria and Romania launched protests and hunger strikes in fervent shows of solidarity with the rebel leader.Kurds came to Rome by bus and car from across Western Europe for a 1,500-strong protest outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed held under tight security.
Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.''In Rome, 1,500 Kurds massed for a second day of demonstrations outside the military hospital where Ocalan is believed to be held.Kurds arrived from Germany and France to show solidarity with the rebel leader and a Kurdish group stopped at Rome's airport launched a hunger strike.
About 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit.President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place during Austria's European Union presidency.Austrian government officials reportedly will try to open up a ``longer-term perspective'' for Turkey's EU membership.
Facing his first real foreign policy test, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema must decide what to do with a prominent Kurdish rebel leader who was arrested at the Rome airport on Thursday.Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.He is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist.
A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday.Turkey has asked for his extradition and Ocalan has asked for political asylum.
INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials said Monday.Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said.On Monday alone, about 70 people were refused entry at the Brenner Pass crossing point.
Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday.Kurdish business leaders said the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.There are some 4,000 Kurds living in Romania.
Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage Sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man.Ocalan is currently being held in Rome.
About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow.He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group.Qin said a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activities.
In response to criticism from home and abroad, Chinese officials broke their silence Wednesday to defend their arrest this week of a prominent dissident who was trying to form an opposition political party.``Xu Wenli is suspected of involvement in activities damaging to national security and has violated relevant criminal codes of the People's Republic of China,'' said a statement from the Foreign Ministry, which on Tuesday declined to comment on the arrest.The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form 
A Chinese dissident fleeing a new round of arrests of democracy activists in Shanghai arrived here Wednesday and announced that he and other opponents of the Chinese government plan a demonstration Thursday at the United Nations to protest the crackdown.The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China.Speaking through an interpreter at Kennedy International Airport, Yao, 44, said little about why he had left 
With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident trials in two years.Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out of options Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a budding opposition political party.Qin's family pleaded for a postponement at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials denied the request.
Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday.Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the group's members, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.Police wanted a list of members with their work and home addresses, a demand An Jun refused for fear of getting 
Protesting the lack of a defense lawyer, the father of a prominent dissident is to seek a delay in his son's subversion trial, scheduled to start on Thursday in the central city of Wuhan.The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party.In a telephone interview Wednesday evening, his father, Qin Qinguo, 76, said that before the trial begins, he plans to hand the court 
China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected of endangering national security _ the clearest sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao refused to specify what laws were broken or how Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin endangered the state.A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human 
China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday.Two Beijing police officers spent 30 minutes telling Zha Jianguo to stop trying to set up a political opposition party.Underscoring the warning, they said his colleague, Xu Wenli, won't be released soon and may be charged for having links to ``reactionary groups,'' Zha said.
One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given to his wife on Monday.The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out over the last year.The charges that Wang faces
The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers.The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session for just two hours and 10 minutes.It appears to be finished, although the court did not announce a decision or say when it would.
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.The fast-spreading fire that broke out just a few minutes before midnight Thursday gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.''The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered.How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story windows?''As long as the technicians haven't established the cause of the fire, we don't know if it
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180 in Sweden's second-largest city.The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, 
A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday.Per-Olof Ortarsen of Goteborg's emergency services line said the call was so hard to understand that it took three minutes for workers to figure out what was going on and where to send fire trucks.The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes

A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180.The fast-spreading fire completely gutted the two-story building and left rescuers facing a hideous scene that local rescue service leader Lennart Olin likened to a ``gas chamber.''Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation.
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180.``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a city of half a million people on the country's west coast.The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them.Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments.Bent metal bars on some of the 
Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria.He called for a ``diplomatic dialogue'' to defuse the tension, said Assad's spokesman Jubran Kourieh.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.Mubarak left after the two-hour meeting without speaking to reporters.But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on the trip, said before their departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power and threats.''
Signaling it does not want to be involved in any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey, Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with Syria.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and Ankara.``We have no part in this tension,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday.
Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday.Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey later this week.
Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria.Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.

Greece on Monday warned that mounting tension between Turkey and Syria could lead to ``tragic results'' if not dealt with in its early stages.``Sources of tension are being created in our region,'' government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.``We will have to deal with these sources from their birth, because they may develop out of control and we will be led to tragic results.''
As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria.Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that Turkey was in a position of self-defense and had suffered for many years from Damascus' sheltering of the autonomy-seeking rebels.Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said.
Turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its southeastern border with Syria amid growing tensions between the two neighbors, newspapers reported Thursday.The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being deployed.Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied any troop movement along the border, but said Turkey's patience was running out.
Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo _ a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war.After trekking several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives.If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, 
Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday.The attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital Kampala, said the spokesman, who identified himself only as Lt. Majera.Majera said the attackers were believed to be rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces who operate from bases in the foothills of the Rwenzori Mountains that straddle the Uganda-Congolese border.
The bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops.Rebel commander Richard Mondo said shelling and ground attacks, which began Monday, continued on Wednesday.
Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on Friday.``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.''

After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold.``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said.
Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing a rebel assault.A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa.Neither claim could be confirmed independently.
A day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people, rebels clashed with government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday.Fighting for the town of Kindu in this vast West African nation subsided after rebels launched an artillery barrage into government-held buildings and the airfield, two miles (three kilometers) away.On Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport.
A day after shooting down a jetliner, Congolese rebels and their Rwandan allies pushed Sunday through government defense lines, showing the confidence of a victor in a week-old battle for a strategic air base.Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away.Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government forces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops 
Back in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had a farm and was the head of a 25,000-strong farmers organization in the northeastern breadbasket of this central African nation.A quarter of a century later, the 56-year-old businessman who also ran hotels and a tourist camp is broke; the farmers group is a memory.Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea exports in half and turned Congo's 
Russian space officials gave the first module of the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into higher orbit, and convened a meeting on Earth to map out its future.Flight controllers fired one of the module's two maneuvering engines to raise it to an orbit about 230 kilometers (157 miles) in space, the station's public affairs office said.Russian Space Agency general director Yuri Koptev told reporters the maneuver was carried out ``with great accuracy,'' and the 24-ton core module was cruising through space without 
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization.Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth.``Success,'' shouted one exultant official some 10 minutes after the giant rocket blasted off and entered orbit.
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday.While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager.NASA was surprised last week when Russia's prime station contractor 
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.
The first part of the international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization.A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned, officials said.Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting 
Two astronauts ventured back out on another spacewalk Wednesday to attach antennas to the international space station under construction nearly 250 miles above Earth.For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay.Their No.
Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay.Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station.It will serve as a space tugboat in the early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and communications.
The first piece of the international space station was orbiting Earth Friday, sprouting antennae and unfolding solar power panels as it awaited other segments, which will eventually grow into the largest orbital laboratory in history.The module, called Zarya from the Russian term meaning sunrise or dawn, took a flawless ride into space atop a three-stage Russian Proton booster rocket that lifted off at 1:40 a.m. Eastern time from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.The launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the 16 nations that are sponsoring 
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.Stacking the two giant cylinders 240 miles above the Earth was considered the most difficult part of the mission.The job fell to Nancy Currie, the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday.
