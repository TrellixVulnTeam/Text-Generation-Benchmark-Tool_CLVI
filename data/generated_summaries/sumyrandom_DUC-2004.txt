The last week seemed to crystallize the long-term decline in political civility.Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, compared Clinton on Friday to Sir Thomas More, executed for treason in 1535 because of his religious beliefs.He quoted More's words as an admonition for today: ``What you have hunted me for is not my actions but for the thoughts of my heart.
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas only precariously held on to his majority-leader post last month and was not considered a likely candidate for speaker.Republicans, indeed Livingston himself, had made this same distinction between Clinton's sexual indiscretions and Livingston's, saying that Clinton lied about his private acts and therefore abused the legal system and his powers.Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., said, ``We are now starting to offer up sacrificial lambs to whatever terrible disease this is.''
``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans, according to lawmakers who were present.Then, as on Thursday night, Republicans voiced suspicions that Democratic defenders of the president instigated media investigations in an effort to embarrass the Clinton's principal accusers.``Some who would rather not struggle with this constitutional question continue to try to twist the debate into an unseemly investigation of private lives,'' said Rep. Dick Armey, the Republican majority leader.
It is unfair.Ordinary Americans could cry out all they wanted.But Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., was probably closer to the truth when he said, ``I warn my colleagues that you will reap the bitter harvest of the unfair partisan seeds you sow today.''
(The House voted 228-206 to approve the first article of impeachment, accusing Clinton of committing perjury before a federal grand jury.Allow us to vote for censure.''Last weekend, when the Judiciary Committee recommended the four articles of impeachment, Clinton's side still hoped to prevail with the help of 20 to 30 Republican moderates who were uncommitted.
As they stood, the Democrats sensed Livingston had most suddenly closed a trap on the president and his defenders.What?''came the reply from the officer, who obviously thought the momentous announcement would be about Clinton's impeachment, not Livingston's political self-immolation.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House.But the one thing that no one should fall for is Livingston's invitation to use his resignation as a model for resolving the crisis at the White House.He may be right that the Constitution requires him to convene a trial
He spent most of the day in a private office off the chamber, avoiding the gauntlet of reporters who lay in wait for him between the House and his regular office across the street.But no one said that Livingston's disclosure or the mild Democratic attempts to exploit it would influence their votes on impeachment.``I will repeat what the nuns taught me at St. James a long time ago: We would all be a hell of a lot better off looking after our own souls rather than trying to evaluate somebody else's.
Tom DeLay, the jagged-edge exterminator who may next-up in the speaker roundelay, was choked up, praising the greatness of Livingston for understanding that this was ``a debate about relativism versus absolute truth.''What could be more relative than a Republican who has hidden a lot of affairs trying to impeach a president for lying about his?The Ship of Fools reached cruising speed on Friday evening, when we had the frightening scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they were railroading through an impeachment even though the United States 
All the networks and cable channels carried the moment that unexpectedly set the tone, as Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, announced during the debate that he would not become House speaker.CBS' corporate decision to try to have it both ways meant that Rather would break in with updates from Washington.On the other networks and cable channels, the vote itself literally happened in the background.
Another, Yang Chen, plays in Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes in France.Englishman Bob Houghton, who coaches the national team, said recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to ``see if they can bring the things they have learned recently in England to the national team,'' the China Sports Daily said.China and South Korea will both field their Asian Games teams at a friendly warm-up match Nov. 22, the newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday.``I have done my best.We have to respect their decision,'' he told the Post.
``It was made very clear to everybody that a referee's decision will be final, but now that the Indians have lodged a formal complaint, we have also done so,'' Khan said.Indian officials were not available for comment.``This is indeed a high step and this will greatly help to make the sport more popular in Asia, which is coming up fast,'' said Singh, whose family migrated to Singapore from India several decades ago.
The Sri Lankan team was led by six dancers in bright costumes, who delighted the crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium with acrobatic maneuvers.After the parade, five of the women collapsed, and three were taken out on stretchers.Several thousand people without tickets milled around outside, waving small Thai flags and waiting for a glimpse of the king.
They did not have the necessary health certificates guaranteeing that they are disease-free, said Siraya Chunekamrai, president of the Veterinary Commission for the games.``They are the most beautiful horses of all,'' she said.There are 106 horses and 12 countries participating in the equestrian events.
The real jewels have never been recovered.``If there is any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said.Officials said that forgiveness was a better option than punishment and that both sides would be admonished not to let a repeat brawl occur.
But the country was able to pull it through, he added.``This is an example of Asia's resiliency.``I am impressed,'' said Tu Mingde, secretary-general of China's Olympic Committee.
Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported.Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from finishing the complex in time for the Dec. 6-20 games.Preparations for the games have been plagued by political interference by previous governments, alleged corruption and incompetence.
Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown on panhandlers.About 100 of those detained were displayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok.Other groups targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games are foreign criminal gangs believed to operate in Bangkok and other major cities in Thailand.
The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and ``night life ideas.''``We don't treat them as kids, telling them don't do this, don't do that.His deputy is a police officer.
U.S. intelligence officials say they now believe that bin Laden was in the camp on the day of the attack, but he appears to have left unscathed before the missiles hit.The order said: ``No person employed by, or acting on behalf of the United States government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination.''The targets included the residence of the Libyan leader, Moammar Gadhafi.
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, and Muhammad Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if carried out on foreign soil.
Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about the ``security'' situation of the cell.A second count charges him with soliciting others to do so.``We, the East Africa cell members, do not want to know about the operations plans,'' he wrote, `` since we are just implementers.''
It is not known whether the source is in custody somewhere, or hiding under government protection.Fazil has since been charged in the embassy attacks and remains at large.The source described taking ``an oath of allegiance'' to follow bin Laden's orders, and gave a detailed account of bin Laden's group, including its history and inner workings.
The Taliban's chief justice accused the United States on Wednesday of looking for an ``excuse'' to launch another missile attack on his war-shattered homeland.``America is looking for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' Saqib said.Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the case will be closed _ at least for the Taliban.
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.He said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other parts of Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal immigrants, who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to Italy in huge numbers.Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday.Police seized copies of the newspaper for reproducing a foreign newspaper interview of Afghanistan-based Saudi billionaire Osama Bin Laden, who has been accused by the United States of masterminding bombing attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August.Men must grow beards of a certain length and criminals are subjected to amputations and public executions Even though Bangladesh is 
A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material.The magazine said much of it was based on the testimony of an FBI informant, a former bin Laden associate, who made only vague connections between Salim and terrorist activities.Zierl declined to comment on the report, but said U.S. authorities probably asked for more time just a precautionary measure.
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia.The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin.
This evidence was uncovered after the United States destroyed Idris' factory in a missile attack following the bombing of the U.S. embassies, the officials said.Still, after the missile strike, when Idris was publicly identified as the owner, U.S. intelligence began to investigate his possible connections to chemical weapons and terrorism.But they said that Islamic Jihad had now been consolidated into bin Laden's terrorist campaign.
Exxon and Mobil are the two largest, strongest competitors to emerge from the nation's most famous antitrust case, the 1911 breakup of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust.Thousands of convenience stores now also sell gasoline produced by a variety of refining companies, and foreign national oil companies, like Venezuela's, sell their supplies through acquired companies like Citgo.But no deals were reached.
But the plywood sheets covering the windows of most of the fast food places and gas stations around Herrington's union hall advertise that the best times are long gone.In tiring and dangerous tasks, they question the elimination of most relief laborers in favor of covering vacations and sickness with overtime (although some like the extra pay, and they say the plant has become safer over the years).Nevertheless, with admirable foresight the union negotiated a clause in last November's three-year contract extension guaranteeing that any company buyer would have to keep 
Let me say right off that I don't think this is a done deal.They are brutally efficient.We are probably heading toward a world in which there are no more than five or six big oil companies, possibly eight.
``It showed that megamergers are doable,'' said Adam Sieminski, an analyst for BT Alex.In the spring, OPEC agreed to reduce production by 2.6 million barrels a day, about 3 percent of the daily world supply of 74 million barrels.``You really do wonder what is the benefit of all that redundancy.''
If the companies were to merge, it would create the largest U.S. company in terms of revenue.A combined company would be bigger than Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest oil company by revenue.In particular, Miller said, the two companies have enormous similarities in their domestic refining and marketing businesses.
But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s.Other analysts and lawyers, while disagreeing that the required divestitures could kill the deal, said the companies would nonetheless have to shed significant operations and that they expected challenges to be raised by a broad spectrum of constituents, including competitors, customers and state officials.Hervey 
It now stands just 41 points short of the record it set Monday and up 1.9 percent for the week.It was up 4.6 percent for the week.It was a shortened trading session, with the New York Stock Exchange closing at 1 p.m., and trading volume, at 257 million shares, made it the lightest day of the year.
But smaller companies may be a better way to play the takeover game.In the energy sector, Houston Exploration qualifies, he says; the oil and gas driller is 66 percent owned by Keyspan Energy.``Both A&AMP;P and Smart and Final are trading at just about book value,'' LaLoggia said.
And with West Texas crude trading at around $12 a barrel, it seems a safe bet oil that won't be selling for $100 a barrel by the turn of the century _ a price some analysts in the early 1980s were predicting it would reach.The only possible problem area there is on the West Coast, but both companies are pretty small players there.During that period, we are going to see a substantial reduction in investment in exploration and production, leading to a reduction in supply coming out of non

There was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the 30-foot (9-meter) boat rolled in wild seas Sunday night near Gabo Island, about 280 miles (450 kilometers) east of Melbourne.The missing boats are veteran cutter Winston Churchill, which sailed in the inaugural 1945 race; B-52; and Solo Globe Challenger.A total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing.The center was unable to identify the sailors, say how they died or give details on the injuries sustained by surviving crewmen.With winds gusting to 80 knots and seas swelling to 10 meters (35 feet), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the three missing yachts.

Monday in 11 cities throughout the country, the players are holding make-shift press conferences at training-camp venues, NBA arenas and gymnasiums.``Last year, the players received about $1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement.A league official said the games would be canceled in blocks of one or two weeks, depending upon circumstances regarding negotiations.
The league already has sued the players over Feerick's jurisdiction.If the owners win, it will remove the last wild card the players had been holding.None has received a paycheck.
I do things that I like to think are in the best interests of the game._ Finally, the players agreed to make marijuana a banned substance.``But there's some possibility.''
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries.The motion was brought last summer on the grounds that no collective bargaining agreement existed and, therefore, he had no jurisdiction to hear the matter.It just means they have to pay 200-some players.
``Today is supposed to be the start of training camp.With wide philosophical differences on how $2 billion annual income should be distributed, both sides have privately said they don't expect to play a regular season game before December.``Everybody's got to get that corrected.
Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season games.I don't think that they're ready to make a deal.''The last formal meeting between both sides on Aug. 6 ended when Stern and the owners abruptly marched out after they had received a proposal from the players.

Last year more players than ever before received the union minimum, then $242,000 for rookies or $272,000 for veterans.The league got its broadcasters, NBC and Time Warner's cable channels, to agree to pay this year's television fees whether or not there are any games to broadcast.It turned aside requests for negotiations this week, saying the players had to meet first.
_ A salary cap credit would go into effect if the league pays out more than 63 percent of revenues in salary.If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season.Currently, the rookie scale is three years and includes a clause that enables a player to exercise his Bird rights after two seasons _ a clause Kevin Garnett parlayed into an astronomical $126 million deal last year with Minnesota.
The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little to strengthen security at the embassy.Unhappily, it was discounted, even thought to be a ruse to lure the embassy into new security measures that terrorists could monitor and defeat.But more decisive leadership in the department could have assured preventive steps were taken in East Africa.
Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country being held under the restrictions.``You can't punish them in advance of any determination of whether they are guilty or innocent,'' he said.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The official, who could not be further identified, said the questioning was aimed at gathering recorded testimony to be used by the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the six men indicted in connection with the attack.Saudi exile Osama

German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday.Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.A suspected top aide of bin Laden, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, is jailed in Germany pending a U.S. extradition request, raising concern about reprisals on German soil.
Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people.But all were able to identify the Suzuki vehicle.Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad Khalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar es Salaam.
``If anything happens to him, America will be responsible.''Washington blames bin Laden's group, al Qaeda, for the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured an estimated 5,000 people.Security measures already in place include cement barricades blocking the road leading to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and razor-sharp barbed wire topping the brick-walled compound.
The lawyers complained that their clients were being held in total isolation for almost 24 hours a day in a unit called 10 South, the most restrictive holding area in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.The judge made his comments in the first hearing in the bombing case since last week's indictment by a federal grand jury of Osama bin Laden, who the authorities believe was the mastermind of the embassy attacks.The lawyers added that the defendants cannot have visitors, write letters, or receive mail or books.

Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director.``There is enough rice.Davies urged the new government to substantially increase annual expenditures on health, education and rural development as a first step in a long-term solution to Cambodia's food crisis.
Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country.He said they had crossed into China seeking food, not because of political repression in North Korea.Citing a North Korean human rights group and Japanese tourists visiting the region, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday that 150 North Koreans had been sent home from China, despite having presented petitions for political asylum.

A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said.The ministry described Kim as a former athlete, but said details of his background and his method of escape from North Korea were not available.The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945.
``It may be worse than last year.''``A lot of the children were too weak to come to school,'' he said.But Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives.
For three weeks this fall, crews led by foreign scientists were finally permitted to fan out across North Korea to conduct the first random sample nutritional survey of children, providing by far the most solid data on the crisis.``People will be small and not as well developed as otherwise and somewhat limited in their mental capacities.''North Korea is a mountainous country, with less than 20 percent arable land.
A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height.Eighteen teams, each headed by a foreign official from the World Food Program, the U.N. Children's Fund or the European Union, carried out the study.Children in North Korea's three largest cities _ Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their counterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished.
The noodles have no nutrition and are indigestible, leaving people holding their aching stomachs, he said.Hall said that the divergence might have arisen because in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, life did seem to be slightly better than during his three previous trips to North Korea.This year's assembly did not expand as previous ones did, but rather had just 687 delegates, the same as the previous assembly held in 1990.
North Korea did not enter the last Asian Games, in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1994.It sent only 18 athletes and officials to the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in February.Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995 devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy, forcing the country to rely on outside aid to feed its 23 million people.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before returning home, aides said.
The 67-year-old president, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside Moscow.His last foreign trip was to Britain in May, when he attended a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev are expected to sign agreements on economic, science and technical cooperation and 
Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to function.Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed that the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.''``Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman 
The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election.But Yeltsin's aides say his first term, from 1991 to 1996, does not count because it began six months before the Soviet Union collapsed and before the current constitution took effect.On Wednesday, parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, voted on a resolution calling on Yeltsin to resign, but it failed narrowly.
Government sources said the president has also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were still going forward.``And because of (Yeltsin's) poor health, he is no longer able to give the country as much time as it demands.''Luzhkov's spokesman Mikhail Solomentsev refused to elaborate on the statement.
Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential decisions'' are needed.There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week.There were no plans to hospitalize Yeltsin, who arrived in Moscow late Monday night from Almaty, Kazakstan, a day earlier than planned.
President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday.Asked about small bandages that were visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office said the president had sustained small burns.It did not say what had caused them.
Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture on this topic.''``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs. Yeltsin declared.At least it will be calmer than it is now.''
The Russian Constitution has a two-term limit for presidents.Yeltsin's growing health problems would also seem to rule out another election campaign.``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to Interfax.
Weakened by a cold yet animated, President Boris Yeltsin defied doctors' orders and quashed rumors he is seriously ill by showing up unexpectedly at the Kremlin on Wednesday.``I can't even sneeze'' without someone making a fuss about it, he joked with Primakov during a meeting Wednesday.He's clearly not a healthy person,'' film director Vladimir Khotinenko was quoted as saying by the daily Kommersant.
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.``I'm terribly sorry that even Salt Lake City _ by far the best place to hold the winter games _ had to use certain methods in order to get the vote,'' Hodler said.``The organizing committee certainly has people of integrity and ethical standards that would stand any investigation.
Samaranch expressed surprise at allegations made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agents were offering to sell I.O.C.Fiat denied the claims on Saturday, but Sunday Howard Peterson, a former senior American delegate to the ski federation, said he had been offered cars by two Fiat executives.But the 78-year-old Samaranch said he had ``great respect'' for Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation or pushing for his expulsion.
Following is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: _ ``The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members _ as well as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions _ any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person.''
``After, the IOC will be even stronger than before.''``No, there is not any kind of possibiity,'' he said.Samaranch said the IOC would possibly consider a new procedure to eliminate the tempations for corruption in the selection of host cities.
Asked whether all Olympic votes are tainted, Hodler said, ``I know of so many times.Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members.``There is no basis for the charges against Atlanta at this point,'' Krimsky said.
``We're not going to make any conclusions or any speculations as to what we may decide until we know what the facts are,'' he said.``There is no chance at all, absolutely none in my mind,'' he said.``I can't be stronger in saying I don't consider it a possibility whatsoever of the games being withdrawn from Salt Lake City. ''
``As far as Nagano is concerned, we haven't done anything wrong.We were selected as host of the Olympics through our efforts.Nagano led in each of the five rounds, beating out Salt Lake city 46 votes to 42 in the final ballot.
Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members.``Yesterday the lawyer of Salt Lake City said, `Everything had been done by Tom Welch, who is not there any more.From 1991 to 1995, the committee _ under the direction of Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC members, mostly from Africa.
But maybe I will be expelled.Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities.
The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been ``muzzled'' by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization.Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign.You never know.''
``We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.The decision, which followed ``frank and candid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by the United States, he said.``The Mir competes with the international space station for very critical resources and for funding,'' Brinkley said.
When the two pieces were aligned within inches of one another, Cabana fired small thruster rockets that raised the shuttle, allowing the modules to clamp together.``We've never done anything like this before,'' Currie said before the flight, adding that she had practiced the difficult maneuver more than 100 times over the last two years.The flight of Endeavour, which took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., last Friday, had gone according to plan until early Sunday, when mission control ordered the shuttle to change its orbit slightly to avoid a 
The historical moment occurred above the South Pacific.The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.That did the trick.The joined modules will be released from Endeavour once all of the work is completed.
The work is further complicated by international politics and worries about money.If mishandled, it can crush and kill.The builders will be Col. Jerry Ross of the Air Force, 50, and Dr. James Newman, 42, a physicist.
But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, forcing a delay.NASA engineers spent the day examining the problem, but found nothing wrong with any of the systems and were confident it would not reoccur.The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity.
The uncommon delay prompted frowns and furrowed brows here, although officials stressed that it was entirely warranted.The weather, forecast to be iffy, turned out to be fine, and the sky was alight with a nearly full moon.Controllers studied the data and discovered a momentary pressure drop on one of the hydraulic systems that control the movements of the shuttle's engines and its rudder and other flight surfaces.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.Mission Control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks.The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.It looked to be a perfect and, hopefully, long-lasting fit.It took several tries, however, for Zarya and Unity to be pulled tightly together.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said.The only other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement part.NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be needed after this mission to assemble the entire orbiting complex.
Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives.This is one of the thorniest issues.House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Erskine Bowles, the president's chief of staff and top negotiator, met for much of the day in the speaker's office, shuttling in and out of ante-rooms with their lieutenants but giving few clues about the nitty gritty details of their talks.
And many male members of Congress seemed persuaded to support coverage of contraceptives for women, since almost all of the 285 federal health plans cover Viagra, the male impotency drug.Thursday, with pressure building to resolve the spending bills before Oct. 9, when temporary financing of the government expires, the negotiators agreed to include the contraceptive measure in their conference report on the $13.4 billion bill for the Treasury Department and Postal service.The provision is aimed at getting rid of Lawrence Noble, the current general counsel, who has investigated 
They say the president's proposals for emergency spending, on such items as the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, fixing the year 2000 computer bug and providing relief to American farmers, will break the limits in last year's balanced-budget agreement.Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to Coburn's position.The White House has proposed buying time on the matter by financing the Commerce, State and Justice departments only for five months.
``The general feeling among many Democrats was that even if we won the case, there would be a lot less leverage in March, especially if it was the only issue left to be debated,'' said a House Democratic official who insisted on anonymity.Democrats contend that now is the time to press the Republicans, while they want to complete work on the budget and go home to campaign.We've been able to accomplish great things, what do you think?
At least in years past, there was a common goal.``In budget terms,'' said Robert Reischauer, a former director of the congressional budget office, ``this is like the end of the Cold War.''In 1990, 1993 and 1995, when politicians staked their careers on striking a budget deal to lower the deficit, the fundamental question was how to divide up the bitter medicine of more taxes and less spending.
Opponents of the road call the project an unjustifiable precedent that threatens the seasonal breeding grounds of protected migratory birds, and they say that improved air or sea service would be a better alternative.Last February Chafee's staff had assembled a score of environmental lobbyists in his office to plan strategy for opposing the road, environmental advocates said Thursday.``And once you go down that road, nobody knows where it is going to end.''
We're not together.''Armey was one of many who castigated the president for apparent disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton has been steeped in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House.But as the high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday afternoon, both sides agreed they would need to extend their deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary financing for the government expires for the third time since the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
We have no tax cuts and far too much spending that I oppose, but that's the nature of compromise.``Clinton was buying votes,'' said Rep. David Hobson, R-Ohio.``The combination of the lessons learned three years ago and the scandal on the president's side yielded the inevitable result, a budget that leans way to the left,'' Tauzin said.
They missed having spending bills in place for the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year, providing temporary financing for the federal government through Oct. 9, then Oct. 12, then Wednesday.One would require federal health plans to cover contraceptives.Democrats like Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who introduced the contraceptive plan in the House, said she strongly objected to Coburn's position.
Excluded were the committee chairmen and the heads of the appropriation committees, who now must write the language that will put the deal into law.My position is, hold the nose and vote yes.Hog farmers in his district, whose biggest customers were Japan and China, had been hit hard by the collapse of Asian markets.
The past week's protests grew out of an increasingly bitter dispute over Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.At the gathering, the PNC and other Palestinians in attendance are to reaffirm the nullification of clauses in their national charter that call for Israel's destruction.Israel has demanded that the Palestinians hold an actual vote at the meeting rather than simply proclaiming the charter changed, but the Palestinians on Sunday repeated their objections to that.
The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoided making any threats against him.Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs
Netanyahu, in an interview with The Associated Press, said the Palestinians were emboldened to foment street riots and threaten to declare statehood because they believed they had the Clinton administration ``in their back pocket.''``We are not going to give up territory when there are violations of the agreement and attempts to get things that weren't achieved at Wye using violence,'' Netanyahu said.The issue has been the focal point for a new wave of violent protests and demonstrations in the West Bank and a hunger strike that began Saturday by the 1,700 Palestinian 
The Palestinians have said they would revoke the clauses only by acclamation, not by a vote, when the Palestine National Council meets on Monday in Clinton's presence.``The procedures need to be clear enough that nullification has taken place,'' he said.A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week.Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs
He is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, before returning to Washington on Dec. 15.In January, Arafat wrote to the White House, listing the anti-Israel provisions that he said had been annulled.And during the talks in Maryland last month, Arafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to ``reaffirm'' the decision to revoke the clauses.
After getting together for breakfast in Clinton's hotel suite, the two leaders met at Netanyahu's office and planned to talk to reporters later.In recent weeks the Palestinians again constantly, systematically and intentionally violated all their commitments.Since Clinton presided over its signing in Washington in October, the land-for-security agreement has hit one snag after another.
``There is cooperation with the American security people.We have our own plan.Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan that has been presented to the Americans.
The West Bank has been swept by stone-throwing protests in recent days, and thousands of Palestinians marched Thursday in the funeral procession of a 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, who was killed by Israeli army gunfire a day earlier.The violence raised concern that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region, which is to start late Saturday, is fomenting more unrest rather than calming the already tense situation.Israel insists a vote be taken by a show of hands, while the Palestinians say only approval by 
Inside, to the tinny recorded wail of Koranic verses, neighbors and relatives of the dead man _ a 21-year-old university student felled on the roof of his own home by an Israeli soldier's rubber-coated bullet _ sipped tiny cups of coffee left unsweetened to symbolize the bitter occasion.The days leading up to Clinton's visit have been divisive ones, contriving somehow to simultaneously tap into both sides' greatest fears.Amr Erekat, 27, recalled his disbelief as he cradled his dying cousin in his arms.
Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past week, but has hit various snags.Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the two assailants and injured 21 Israelis.``This attack is a gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said.
The Cabinet said it would not resume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian Authority has taken steps against terrorism.The procedure is part of the Wye River agreement negotiated last month.However, Israelis and Palestinians have widely divergent interpretations of how the clauses should be rescinded.
I'm going to Paradise.''Tahayneh had his own score to settle with the Israelis.He wasn't nervous.''
``The United States understands the delay by a day or two but expects the agreement to be approved soon,'' Albright told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone, Channel Two reported.One of Israel's key demands is that the Palestinians do more to fight attacks by Islamic militants against Israeli targets.At the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no lives other than those of the assailants were lost.
Shallah's claim of responsibility from abroad contrasted with the muted response of Islamic Holy War's leadership in the Gaza Strip, which has reportedly given commitments to the Palestinian Authority to refrain from such attacks.A Palestinian security official said several Islamic Holy War members were arrested in the West Bank on Friday night.``We never thought he would do something like this,'' said Muhammad Zughayer, Youssef's father.
Aides to Netanyahu were not immediately available for comment.Just a block away from the blast, shoppers went about their business.``This is a crime and whoever commits this, hurts the interests of the Palestinian people.''
Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism.Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled all of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic militants.Groundbreaking there in March 1997 led to a break-off in negotiations with the Palestinians.
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy.''Palestinian security sources and the families of the dead bombers had already identified them as Islamic Jihad activists.
An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.One lived near the Anata refugee camp, north of Jerusalem, and the other lived in the West Bank village of Silat al Harithiya, outside the town of Jenin.At the market, some 200 observant Jews gathered Saturday night near the site of the bombing to offer prayers of thanks that no lives other than those of the assailants 
A young female soldier patted her arm consolingly.a small crowd of demonstrators shouted.``That was a miracle from heaven.''
``The shooting in St. Petersburg is a grim lesson for the whole of Russia,'' Yarov said.But as outrage mounted over her killing, the government announced that she would be interred in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in the city's center following the funeral at the Ethnography Museum.It was not clear whether the shooting was related to Starovoitova's death.
Seleznyov responded in kind on Monday, suggesting that the ``extremists from democratic organizations'' might have staged the murder in order to win local elections set for Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency reported.She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in 1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle _ and later joined the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal defenders of liberal reforms.Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' and said he would personally monitor the investigation into her killing.
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said.Born in the Ural Mountains city of Chelyabinsk, Starovoitova was trained as a psychologist and later received a doctorate in history.There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently.
``This is impossible to tolerate any longer,'' said Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of Yabloko, another reform-oriented party.St. Petersburg has been especially plagued.Yet, as remarkable as that news was, it has been vastly overshadowed by the death of Starovoitova.
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.She had said she would run again in 2000.A finance official was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last month.
Linkov was seriously injured, it said.A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment on the report.She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet.
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said.Starovoitova tried to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical reasons.There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.
Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia.She championed democracy and human rights long before they became politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers as Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet Union disintegrated.Her countrymen can honor her memory by following her example.
An aide was also shot and critically wounded.More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova.A pistol with a silencer and and automatic rifle were found at the scene, ITAR-Tass said.
The police say the two were attacked in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, one of them a young woman.Two guns were found at the scene.Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's democratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for the killing remains unclear.
Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats _ President Clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail.Pausing after a campaign fund-raising breakfast with former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey here on Wednesday, Ms. Boyle said: ``This has been a marathon and it's been pretty 
At a rally for the president outside city hall here Friday night a group of Teamsters chanted, ``two more years.''That argument, of course, would also insulate Clinton from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote.``They killed the minimum wage increase for 12 million Americans.
Dr. Rymer says she was incensed.Kenneth Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in election law and represents both Democratic and Republican clients, said, ``I have never heard of that particular device.''Later, Nancy says: ``As a member of his committee, you would be receiving from the speaker our national leadership award, which is really quite an honor.
Of the 34 Senate seats in play, 18 are held by Democrats and 16 by Republicans, who now hold 55 seats in all.In contests like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against impeachment.And Schumer plans to campaign in New York on Monday with Clinton at his side.
Although it may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky.Rivera's union and the teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in New York.Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 350,000 members in New York State.
The intensity of the debate surrounding the endorsement underscores the importance of the New York Senate race to Democrats across the nation, who see defeating D'Amato as one of their best opportunities to prevent the Republicans from gaining 60 seats in the Senate _ enough to stop a Democratic filibuster.Saturday, Schumer picked up his own endorsement from New York's largest gay and lesbian political organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda.Largely because of the group's strong Democratic ties, gay Democrats, New York liberals and White House officials are infuriated that 
They said they would probably make an endorsement by Friday.Although the organization has been thought to be inching toward a D'Amato endorsement for months, the lobbying campaign for Schumer has picked up intensity in the last two weeks, driven partly by a growing sense that the race is now closer than ever.The Human Rights Campaign is considered the most influential gay and lesbian organization in Washington, with a national membership of 250,000 and an annual budget of more than $13 million.
Mrs. Carson, fairly liberal, is a House freshman who worked her way up in politics from the grass roots, having been reared in poverty.The Carson campaign is counting on voters like Timothy Daly, a 38-year-old real estate executive who voted for a Republican two years ago but now favors Mrs. Carson.Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal, Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue: education.
Nearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted Friday to condemn the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939.There are plenty of other items whose sponsors hope will not attract attention.But some Democrats are close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican goals, that their measures are taken seriously.
Glenn, the former astronaut who is preparing to return to space this month at the age of 77, has not made an endorsement in the Senate race.Indeed, as a boy, Voinovich once delivered newspapers to the Boyle home in the working-class Collinwood section of Cleveland.Voinovich, while campaigning vigorously himself, is keeping a full schedule of official duties, assuming the role of the experienced, elected official.
Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem.In contrast, James Charles Kopp, who is being sought as a material witness in the killing of Slepian, left a trail of clues about his motives.Later, Kopp was associated with the Lambs of Christ, an another militant anti-abortion group.
The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence.A photograph of Kopp taken in January 1997 has been distributed to law enforcement agencies around the United States and Canada.Slepian was one of only a handful of doctors in Buffalo who were still willing to perform the procedure in the face of pickets, protesters and threats.
There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses.Another problem is that few Canadian medical schools offer training in abortion.``As a regulator we have to stay at arm's length, so we can judge an application impartially.''
And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail.Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue members, according to some people who were there, Kopp remained in jail for 40 days and adhered to Terry's orders not to give a real name to the police or courts.The five attacks, all since 1994, occurred in the weeks leading up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day _ called Remembrance Day in Canada 
There is a schedule.Most of the protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among the thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of anti-abortion activity in Buffalo.Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, said she identified with the clinic patients.
Even as they searched for Kopp, federal officials were also looking into three letters that were received Monday by Catholic and antiabortion organizations in Buffalo, Indianapolis and Chicago.Those letters, saying they contained the deadly anthrax bacteria, came 10 days after eight similar threats to clinics that provide abortions.All the letters appear to be hoaxes, and it remains unclear whether they were connected to any of the five shootings.
They now number roughly 1.5 million a year, according to reports by Guttmacher, or 1.4 million, according to the National Right to Life Committee, the nation's largest anti-abortion group, which calculates its estimate partly from the Guttmacher figures.Laura Echevarria, director of media relations for the National Right to Life Committee, contends, however, that most teaching hospitals do train gynecologists in procedures for treating miscarriages that are similar to those used for performing abortions.When the pill was introduced in France and in Edinburgh, Scotland
She and her family live in a rambling old home on the shore of Lake Ontario, and every morning, she gives her husband, John, a peck on the cheek before he goes to work.An Army veteran, he has been a leader of the anti-abortion movement for more than 25 years, they say, and founded a home for unwed mothers.``He'd sit around and play video games with us and make us model planes out of wood.''
Rejected by medical schools in the United States _ the fate of two out of three applicants in the late 1960s _ he studied one year in Belgium and then enrolled at the Autonomous University for Medicine in Guadalajara, Mexico.He once insisted on going to the top of the World Trade Center, despite a crippling fear of heights.He wasn't done living yet.''
While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers like Slepian over the last five years.Kenny remembered Kopp as a ``really nice guy,'' who did chores around the place but paid no rent to the parents.There were Kryptonite locks and leaflets from the Army of God and the Lambs of Christ.
Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers.Alan Cormack of the United States and Sir Godfrey Hounsfield may not be familiar names, but what they won the prize for in 1979 is a term known by most patients: computer-assisted tomography _ or CAT scan.The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year.
``I have not come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago, an atheist, at the time.He has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend.Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.
A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers.Lisbon City Hall rushed out posters saying ``Congratulations Jose Saramago'' which were hung up around the capital during the night.He never finished university but continued to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska, as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
The academy keeps its deliberations secret.``Absolutely not!For his part, Saramago, 75, said in a recent Associated Press interview that he's weary of speculation that this year, once again, he might win.
In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised Saramago ``who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality.''``I think I hear in his prose echoes of Enlightenment sensibility, caustic and shrewd.''In his next novel, ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis,'' which is also a homage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who appears in it as a ghost, Saramago sets his story in the early years of the Salazar dictatorship, with the tale following the romantic

Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.``Signal transmission by a gas that is produced by one cell, penetrates through membranes and regulates the function of another cell represents an entirely new principle,'' the citation said.Winners generally aren't known outside the medical community, although the list of laureates contains a few familiar names including Ivan Pavlov, tuberculosis pioneer Robert Koch, and DNA researchers Francis 
The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978, about five weeks before that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not give him the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in the 1978 awards citation ``the positive initiative taken by President Jimmy Carter.''The Nobel Prizes were endowed by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist whose 355 inventions included dynamite.Four years after Begin won the prize, the Israeli prime minister ordered an invasion of southern Lebanon in which thousands of civilians died.
The prize, for physiology or medicine, went to Dr. Robert Furchgott, 82, of the State University of New York in Brooklyn; Dr. Louis Ignarro, 57, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad, 62, of the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.Dr. Valentin Fuster, the president of the American Heart Association and the head of cardiology at Mt.Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that ``the discovery of nitric oxide and its function is one of the most important

Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.Qin said a civil affairs official in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan accused him of engaging in illegal activities.His visit has drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners.
The trials of three outspoken dissidents over, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin signaled Wednesday that China will sustain a crackdown on dissent throughout next year.``Our active developments of foreign affairs has reached new achievements,'' Jiang said.In addition, 214 dissidents in China planned a 100-day series of rotating 24-hour fasts beginning Thursday to protest the sentences, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Wednesday night.
The dissidents _ Xu Wenli, who was sentenced Monday to 13 years in prison, Wang Youcai, who received an 11-year sentence, and Qin Yongming, who was reported to have received 12 years were charged with subversion.James Foley, a State Department spokesman, said the United States ``deeply deplores'' the jail terms and called for the immediate release of the dissidents.He said that while there had been some signs of progress in the human rights situation in China over the last year _ notably, China's agreement to 
1 Intermediate People's Court, police detained two of Xu's colleagues Sunday and kept watch on the homes of at least two others, friends and a Hong Kong-based rights group reported.Doctors found tumors, perhaps cancerous, in the 50-year-old's mouth, stomach and bowels, Liu Qing said.``He hasn't even read the whole indictment.
The 13-year prison term given Xu Wenli after a 3 1/2-hour trial in Beijing was the longest for a Chinese dissident in three years.Last Thursday, Wang and Qin faced trials without legal counsel after police detained or scared off potential lawyers.Wary of the China Democracy Party's appeal, scores of uniformed and plainclothes police sealed off Beijing's No.
Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the State Department.With the sentencing of Xu, China's Communist government has silenced one of its most energetic and persistent critics, one who has given over his adult life to the cause of democracy.He said Xu had told her, ``I can't change the way I am.''
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed.``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed, Fischer said in a statement.Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed.``The reaction of Chinese courts is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed
China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the United States.After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother said.In the only official comment on the release, the Xinhua News Agency reported that judicial departments took into account Liu's health and behavior in 
In her first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate.Washington does not favor more direct aid.And she urged the world _ and American critics _ to ``be patient with the workings of the democratic process in Russia'' and ``not start each day by taking a census of reformers in the Kremlin,'' a census that American officials themselves promoted before 
An adviser to the Communist Party leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, made headlines not long ago when he called the new government bourgeois.The deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, Yuri Maslyukov, is a Communist Party figure who once headed Gosplan, the infamous central-planning program that helped bring the Soviet Union to ruin.``Support for the Communists is at its smallest level, maybe 20 percent.''
Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors said it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their money in banks.The measure was meant to prevent mass withdrawals of deposits that most Ukrainian banks have already experienced as people, scared by the fall of the national currency and the turmoil in neighboring Russia, started to stock up on food, clothing and household goods.Government officials say that Ukrainians have recently withdrawn at least 10

The selling spree, amid worries about shrinking corporate profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3 percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of 9,337.97 reached on July 17.Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent Thursday, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds since 1967.Asked why stock markets, particularly in the United States, have reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, Camdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored, especially if financial leaders show resolve in 
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman said Friday.Calls for Soviet-style controls _ part of the plan drafted by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov and leaked to the press _ have apparently created a rift within the Cabinet.Revenues totaled 14.3 billion rubles (dlrs 875 million), 700 million rubles (dlrs 43 million) less than expected.
Kuchma urged the economists to come up with recommendations before a national meeting of economists in November, the Interfax news agency reported.National Bank chairman Viktor Yushchenko was in Washington this week for consultations with IMF officials.Kuchma met Friday with Yushchenko, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko and other senior officials to discuss ways to stabilize the hryvna.
Primakov said foreign investors are ``the force'' that will help Russia to minimize its losses from the current economic crisis.He said Russia wanted long-term investments.This, he said, ``is not to our liking or yours.''
``It has yet to be worked out.''In most nations such a statement might provoke alarm.A newspaper, Kommersant Daily, published it in full Thursday morning.
``They expressed their concern about what's happening and the statements coming out of the Philippines,'' Brillantes told radio station DZXL in Manila.Brillantes said: ``The expression of personal opinion is allowed in our culture and it is not surprising for that to happen.''``We feel that being observers to his trial will be our silent statement of our democratic aspirations for all Asia,'' the group said in a statement.
After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim.The meeting was delayed for almost 90 minutes when a mechanical fault was discovered in one of two Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and his entourage through heavy rain from Singapore.Habibie apologized when Estrada finally arrived at the Melia Panorama Hotel.
``We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform packages that we see being proposed in front of your government today,'' said business council chairman George David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp. Thailand was hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis, and the proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving the massive bad debt of private companies, which is hindering a recovery.``This is very aggressive, good reform.The council's lobbying efforts with the U.S. and Southeast Asian governments have concentrated 
Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks of nationwide rallies at which he called for government reform and Mahathir's resignation, he was arrested under a law that allows police to hold him indefinitely, and prevent him from seeing his family and lawyers.After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia next 
``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,'' said Chia Yew Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore.``There is no way the likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China.But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has stirred anger and sparked growing social unrest in Malaysia.
The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote regional economic stability.Many of Asia's economies have plunged into recession since that agreement.Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed their banking sectors.
Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and argues that only sovereign nations are allowed to send their heads of state.APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan
Other well-respected economists are going even further, questioning whether a free-market philosophy doesn't leave some countries too vulnerable to the chaos of major market speculators.But even he is having major domestic problems.It has set APEC back, and there is no silver bullet to solve the crisis right away,'' said Wolf.
Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit.It's expected to be a hot affair.Russia, Vietnam and Peru will also join APEC this year.
Anwar has been accused of engaging in homosexual acts illegal under Malaysia law, but the charges are generally seen as a pretext for his political persecution.In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case.On attending the APEC meeting, he said, ``It's difficult for me.''
At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was in intensive care for five days, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, received about 6,000 electronic messages of condolences.Friends at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyo., have set up The Matthew Shepard Memorial Fund to raise money to pressure the state legislature to pass anti-hate crime legislation.In a survey of the nation's 42 largest school districts, 76 percent do not train teachers on issues facing gay students, and 42 percent do not have 
In death, he has become a national catalyst for a new drive to guarantee for gay people the right to physical safety.On hearing of the protest, the Casper City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests during funerals.Jim Geringer had warned in advance that anti-gay protesters were ``just flat not welcome.''
``The best way to characterize that is by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the packing plant.''After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants stole his wallet and shoes and left him tied to the fence.On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled to understand the incident.
Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia.Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people.The police commander said that the two women helped the two men dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men make anti
``Matt believed that if he had made one person's life better, he had succeeded,'' his cousin, the Rev.Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters.At the University of Wyoming this fall, football players will wear yellow and green stickers on their helmets in memory of Shepard.
But mourners stood in front of them, singing ``Amazing Grace'' and holding umbrellas to block the sight of the spectacle from friends and family members entering the church.``I just wanted to pay my respects to him and his family.''Kreifels recalled in an interview Thursday that his only mishap of the ride, ``I hit this big limestone rock and did one over the handlebars.''
His death, announced at Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that followed word of last week's attack, spawning nationwide vigils, producing a call for federal hate-crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws in a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted them.But investigators also said Shepard's sexuality may have been a factor.McKinney and Morales suffered head injuries in the brawl; McKinney was arrested when he sought treatment at the same hospital where Shepard died.
Geringer said that Shepard's father also said: ``Don't rush into just passing all kinds of new hate-crimes laws.But they added that they hoped the death would have an impact on legislators around the nation.In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because of their sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama group that tracks violence against minorities.
But it's really about stirring up the fear that produces hate.If these ads were truly aimed at gay people, they wouldn't be broadcast at extravagant cost to the wide general audience reached by TV, and they wouldn't be trumpeted in Washington, insuring free national exposure, three weeks before Election Day.The ads themselves, despite the sugar-coating of ``hope,'' ooze malice.
Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches near the campus.Under a brace of pistols, an advertising appeal for a state history museum had been changed, he said, from ``Shoot a Day or Two,'' to ``Shoot a Gay or Two.''On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated.
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua.That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, Bolanos said.
Police and soldiers patrolled the streets, and a few people wandered amid the boarded-up houses.``We couldn't go out on a boat, we couldn't go snorkeling.At its peak, Mitch was the fourth-strongest Caribbean hurricane in this century, behind Gilbert in 1988, Allen in 1980 and the Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent of the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's storm.The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 ecu (dlrs 480,000).The full 6.8 million ecu (dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through humanitarian groups working in the region.
Honduran doctors dispensed vaccinations to prevent disease outbreaks in shelters crammed with refugees.El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala said 194 of its people had been killed.``We have to vaccinate the children,'' said Dr. Mario Soto, who has treated at least 300 children at the shelter for diarrhea, conjunctivitis and bacterial infections.
It also was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms).``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which was within miles (kms) of the eye of the hurricane.At its, 4th graf pvs
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground.The 350-mile (560-kilometer) wide hurricane was moving west at 8 mph (12 kph).Mitch posed no immediate threat to the United States, forecasters said, but was expected to remain in the northwest Caribbean for five days.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies have been overwhelmed.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs
In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday.Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating but threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, intended to visit Nicaragua on Friday to learn more about the hurricane's impact, The Carter Center in Atlanta announced.``We hope this visit will help call attention to the suffering and humanitarian need this disaster has created,'' Carter said in a statement.Nicaraguan leaders previously had refused Cuba's offer of medical help, saying it did not have the means to transport or support the doctors.
``We need an agenda first of all,'' he said.Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi also admitted mistakes, saying his party had not presented a clear enough message in the final 96 hours of the campaign.Any move to remove him remains a long-shot.
With a promise to balance the budget, end welfare and represent more conservative social values, he appeared to have rearranged the political map for Congress just as Ronald Reagan had done for the presidency.But it was mainly a reaction to the ease with which he had diverted what was supposed to be the flood tide of their revolution.The government that was seen as the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again looked like a potential ally.
Florida has the fourth-largest.He called all but explicitly for the ouster of Gingrich.Tuesday proved the potency of education as an issue, and suggested that it will emerge as a major theme of the 2000 campaign.
``We need an agenda first of all,'' he said.``If you look at all the results,'' he said, ``they are clear and unambiguous.The American people want their business, their concerns, their children, their families, their future addressed here.
In his second conference call, according to several people who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.According to another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of his resignation: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members.In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had fostered.
But Gingrich's counter-campaign has given some members pause about ousting him.They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist.How much?
House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders.Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a struggle for votes.Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, after he had determined if he could win.
``We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males running the Washington Republican Party,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida.One of the first difficult questions now facing Congress is how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry in the face of public resistance to removing Clinton from office, and with a Republican majority now so slim that it is almost certain that the 218 votes required for impeachment cannot be assembled.``I think any serious effort to remove President Clinton from office is effectively over,'' he 
``To maintain our majority, we've got to moderate some of our views,'' Boehlert said.He's nurtured a relationship with them.''``Until we look at it better, I frankly don't understand all the things that happened yesterday,'' he said, ``and I'm not sure anybody else in the country does either.''
The right wing, they're bouncing off the walls.``If Gephardt people think they've quieted me down,'' he said, ``I'm not quieted.''Carville insisted that he would rather do battle with Republicans than with his fellow Democrats.
Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release.``We have been scrupulously fair to Mr. de Klerk and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.In commenting on the newspaper report, Tutu said that more than 400 people had been notified they would be implicated to give them a chance to respond.
The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of land mines on border farms, abuses at its military camps in Angola and bombings.
``We have been scrupulously fair to de Klerk, and we reject the contention that we have been engaged in a vendetta against him.''A spokesman for the party, Thabo Masebe, said the party would seek an injunction in the morning before the report is officially handed over to Mandela.``The ANC and the millions of people who were part of this struggle will always be proud of what they did to insure that, in the process of the destruction of a vile system, they did not themselves resort to vile methods of struggle on the basis 
Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society.``We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said.Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms totaling more than 200 
It has fulfilled its mandate of telling the fullest truth possible, which is one reason that every political party in South Africa has denounced it.No society can be restored to health by papering over as much pain as South Africans have suffered.No commission can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's was.
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South Africa.As expected, the report called apartheid a ``crime against humanity.''But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with land mines and bombs.
``We have always worked on the principle of that we will prosecute the highest rank,'' he said.The commission has the ability to grant amnesty to those who admit their misdeeds and are found to have acted with political motives.The commission found her accountable for human rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected opponents.

Society would then be able to move on, its wounds cleansed and healed.But South Africa's _ the biggest and most powerful, able to grant amnesty and to subpoena witnesses _ was supposed to be the real test.But it will be years before the effect of the commission can truly be judged.
With the ANC now in power and facing an election in mid-1999, a condemnation by the commission could prove damaging both to its electoral chances and moral standing.He said that if the commissioners recommends prosecutions against anyone for abuses, it will be up to the national director of prosecutions to decide whether to proceed.The panel refused, to avoid appearing biased.
Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or how long he would stay.Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which were imposed 
``Libya has confirmed its seriousness and readiness to find a solution to the Lockerbie problem.``It's been almost 10 years since the Pan Am 103 tragedy, this has gone on for far too long.''U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's trip into the desert in a four-wheel drive vehicle to meet with Gadhafi in a tent with a roaring fire outside.
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed in a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister in a tent.The television gave no other details about the visit.
The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.State-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying Sunday that ``a solution to this crisis is within reach.''U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Annan was taken on an hour's trip into the Libyan desert in 
The remark was made without elaboration at a news conference in Algiers hours before his arrival in Tunis, his final scheduled stop on a tour aimed at unblocking plans for a U.N. referendum on the disputed Western Sahara.A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges.During his Algerian stay,
A total of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the jetliner blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya, restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil equipment.On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi to iron out the details.
This position would indicate that Gadhafi is giving himself enough diplomatic room in the event he decides against giving up the suspects.On Friday, Annan said the U.N. team ``has done some good work on the Lockerbie dossier.''The U.N. sanctions on Libya do not cover oil exports, Libya's economic lifeblood.

Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi began a surprise visit to neighboring Tunisia on Monday, his first known trip since injuring his hip in July.Col. Gadhafi, whose country is under a U.N. air embargo, arrived by land for ``a visit of brotherhood and rest'' at the invitation of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, an official statement said.The move was aimed at forcing Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
In a separate service in London's Westminster Abbey, attended by Blair, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds listened as one-by-one the names of the 259 passengers and 11 of Lockerbie's own residents were read out as a candle was lit for each.It is a declaration that we will not rest until we have justice and truth, until all who are responsible for your deaths are held accountable,'' he said.Last week, Libya's Parliament 
The Group of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and China, two of the world's largest economies, had become the ``dikes of resistance'' to global recession.Protecting their economies from the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, he said.
But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to make ordinary purchases.Among the most surprising elements of Tuesday's report is that more than a third of August's deficit was with one country that so far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global troubles: China.The Chinese _ besieged by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis _ have signaled 
Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence.New income, fuel and bank transaction taxes are expected to be proposed.While incumbent governor Mario Covas, a Cardoso ally who is seeking re-election, has committed himself to the austerity plan, Covas opponent Paulo Maluf is a question mark.
There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers.The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office.In powerful Minas Gerais state, the government will almost certainly have to lay off workers _ the state payroll consumes 78 percent of the budget.
An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue facing the world at the moment.Emphasizing the scale of the threat, Castro said President Clinton was aware that ``if South America falls into crisis, it will be extended inevitably also to the United States,'' which is heavily involved in investments and loans in the region.``Countries that have progressive policies should not be penalized, they should be given incentives,'' Gama added in reference to Latin American nations' efforts to 
This early warning from the administration reflects memories of how Congress erupted with objections and hearings in 1995 when President Clinton committed $20 billion in U.S. funds to the bailout of Mexico.The biggest role in the rescue program for Brazil will be taken by the International Monetary Fund, which said last week that it would contribute at least $15 billion _ and appears to be under pressure from the United States to do even more.``I think there are a lot more people in Congress who are now scared to death by what's been happening 
Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus.``The idea is completely unacceptable,'' said Joao Antonio Felicio, secretary-general of the federation, which represents more than 2,000 unions and 19 million workers.In an effort to prevent a collapse of the nation's currency, the real, and stem capital flight, interest rates were hiked to 50 percent a year.
Important allies of Cardoso are lagging behind in three key states, and despite the government promises, market analysts did not expect an announcement until after the elections.With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest economy and is the financial engine of Latin America.Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week.
Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital.Three barber shops in the palace were closed, and the use of cellular phones and copiers was restricted.Federal money would automatically be cut off if spending gets out of hand.
Despite the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had agreed on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors continued to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil.The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3.0 percent in 2001 which would '' fulfill the government target of stabilizing the ratio of net consolidated public sector debt to GDP by 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen.In a short letter sent to news agencies, the king said he had received copies of cooperation agreements signed Monday that will place Hun Sen and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of fiscal and administrative functions in the government.The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of political deadlock 
``We respectfully advise the Asian Development Bank not to provide any new loans to the current regime in Cambodia,'' the two party leaders wrote.``At best the current regime could be considered a caretaker government as it has not been approved by the National Assembly.''The opposition has insisted that any further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and recently guaranteed opposition members' safety inside the country.
It was one of the main stumbling blocks in months of discord.Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head.Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form a coalition and made ``important concessions.''
The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included.In the most recent elections, held in July, Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government.A series of negotiations to forge a new government have failed.
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations.``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice to the CPP, Hun Sen and the Cambodian 
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the polls, but a strong second-place finish by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC gave the royalist party leverage in post-election negotiations.After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.``When we had two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were made more politically than technically.''
In a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk _ the prince's father and Cambodia's head of state _ that was broadcast on television Tuesday, Hun Sen said that guarantees of safety extended to Ranariddh applied to all politicians.Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning of ministries in the new coalition government.Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party.Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.In his speech, Hun Sen blamed the violence on opposition leaders, saying the demonstrations instigated social and economic 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.The opposition, alleging widespread fraud and intimidation, refused to accept the results of the polls.The 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' the political crisis.Hun Sen, however, rejected that.Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread fraud.
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post.He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.''The government is run by the joint efforts of the three officials.
Lebanese media said the matter was settled Monday at a meeting in Damascus between outgoing President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, whose country dominates its weaker, smaller neighbor.Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury, a Hrawi confidant, said Tuesday that Lahoud is expected to be elected by the 128-member Parliament at an extraordinary session on Oct. 15.Lahoud's nomination ends weeks of suspense over the identity of the next head of state.
``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said in a live interview with CNN.Such an action ``might put the country in danger,'' Hariri warned.In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
``I'm not a candidate,'' Hariri said in a live interview with CNN.Hariri's Cabinet has been serving in a caretaker capacity since Lahoud's inauguration last Tuesday.Central bank officials on Monday tried to calm fears about a run on the Lebanese pound by announcing that the bank was ready to intervene with its foreign currency reserves if necessary, the state-run National News Agency reported.
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
According to the constitution, a president must begin his term by appointing the prime minister and a Cabinet through a decree issued after consulting with Parliament members.He is also credited with stabilizing the currency and restoring confidence in the postwar economy.Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi.
Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war.
There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister.A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia, Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country.
A total of 113 deputies voted for the amendment and four deputies against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a presidential aspirant.The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves office.Many hope he will copy his success with the military in the government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public funds.
Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related.``It raises a strong suspicion,'' Clinton said at a joint news conference with Kim at the Blue House, the presidential mansion overlooking the capital.In remarks in Tokyo on Friday, Clinton rejected the idea of compensation.
But, speaking at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had ``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors.Saturday, Clinton called that site, together with North Korea's test firing in August of a missile over Japan, ``cause for deep concern.''The North Koreans have denied that the complex is intended to help build nuclear weapons.
He has long been a burr in Washington's side, denouncing America, its currency traders and its Jews.Some leaders mysteriously escape mention, like Kim Jong Il of North Korea.``The rules for calling for the end of a regime are pretty murky,'' said Richard Feinberg, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who served in the Clinton administration's first term.
It was activity at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development.The Yongbyon complex, which houses a 500-megawatt laboratory nuclear reactor, has been frozen under the 1994 accord.It has offered to open the facility to U.S. inspectors, but says Washington must pay compensation if the facility is been proven to be for civilian use.
The foundation of U.S. efforts to ease North Korea's decades-long hostility toward the South is a 1994 ``agreed framework'' in which the North halted its nuclear weapons program in exchange for a Western commitment to build modern nuclear energy sources there.U.S. special envoy Charles Kartman on Friday retracted an assessment he made Thursday that there was ``compelling evidence'' that North Korea is building an underground nuclear facility.Japanese steel is the biggest problem, but South Korean steel exports also are on the rise.
The general staff of the North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the situation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections and talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.Washington demands unconditional inspections of the North's underground project.Believed to be a test of its Taepo Dong missile, the rocket flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean.
So we are not expecting to walk in one day and be able to have access the next.''The trip was announced as signs grow about a relative warming of relations between the United States and North Korea.In addition the White House disclosed that the United States would provide more heavy fuel oil promised to North Korea under the 1994 agreement, despite concerns that North Korea may intend to revive its nuclear program.
U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed for access to the site.The administration has expressed growing concern over North Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, including the underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last August of a missile over Japan.
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.North Korea has admitted that it is facing serious economic difficulties, but there have been sharply diverging assessments of how serious these are.In an indication of the seriousness with which professional demographers view the situation, the U.S. Bureau of the Census recently published estimates suggesting that North Korea's population peaked in 1995 at 
``You know you're only four minutes away from a missile.''The official crowd estimate was only 3,500, but the turnout seemed even smaller.``It definitely caught me off guard,'' Thomas said.
But Microsoft, responding to the Internet revolution, entered the market aggressively, quickly matching the quality of Netscape's technology and then bundling the Microsoft browser, Internet Explorer, into its industry-standard Windows operating system and giving it away free.Among large corporations, Sun's version of Unix, Solaris, is among the most popular operating systems for the powerful computers that run Netscape's server software.Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial.
A completed deal could be announced as soon as Monday morning.At the same time, however, it would subsume Netscape, an Internet software maker once regarded as the most serious challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the personal computer software market.Thus, Microsoft argues, antitrust policy should tread gently.
The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates' credibility.''That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder, described in an earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond that wants to see us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written communication.The contradiction between Gates' deposition 
In fact, those two strains are blurring together, as exemplified by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group.It has been rewriting the software that lets companies open online stores to be based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the specific computer language used only on America Online.There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in electronic commerce.
And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company issues gained 3.86 points, or nearly 1 percent, to 398.15.American Express was up 4 3/8, to 108 15/16.Other Internet stocks also surged, and analysts said the group, which has seen meteoric gains in recent weeks, was ripe for a steep correction.
``Most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need to get into the e-commerce space,'' said America Online president Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday.Forrester Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services that range from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire online stores.Netscape does have an expanding force of about 700 people who provide consulting and custom programming.
``From a legal standpoint, this proposed deal pulls the rug out from under the government,'' William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for legal affairs, said Monday morning on the courthouse steps.Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems.Warren
Part of that vision rests on an alliance with Sun Microsystems that America Online negotiated as part of the deal.As is the case with any software company, Netscape's key asset is its talented programmers, and many of these code hackers may be reluctant to work for America Online, which still has a reputation as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers, known derisively as ``newbies.''In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had ``morphed itself'' 
In addition, only a couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest online service, was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as ``America On Hold.''Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players.But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft has bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to America Online.
In the new media business, as in traditional media like television or newspapers, eyeballs translate into advertising revenue.Steve Case, the chairman, was once a new-product manager for Pepsico's Pizza Hut chain, while Robert Pittman, the president, is a former MTV executive.But so far, Microsoft has started slowly in the fields of Internet media and electronic commerce.
Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.The dlrs 75 million airport will provide a boost to the troubled Palestinian economy, permitting the export of Palestinian flowers and farm produce that until now were shipped out via Israel, often with difficulties and delays.Israel's government does not permit Israelis to use the Palestinian airport, citing security reasons.
The airport has been nearly completed for months.It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.The airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he told The Associated Press.Gen. Fayez Zeidan.Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
The plane left with the passenger aboard, but without his luggage.``We are all doing all our best to continue the peace process.''Israel retains security control over flights arriving at Gaza International Airport, and Palestinian security officials consult with their Israeli counterparts.
It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport.After touring the airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work needed to be done before the airport was ready for Clinton.The airport will be the first unfettered access route Palestinians will have out of the Gaza Strip.
However, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that this might change in the future.A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing 727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia next week.
``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he told The Associated Press.Yarkoni said he conveyed the message in a letter Monday to chairman of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority Brig.Gen. Fayez Zeidan.
Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International Airport is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and a lot of patriotic pride.``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border.The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez Zeidan, was not available Monday for comment.
The plane will return later in the day.Jasser Ziyyad, director-general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between them _ two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan.Meanwhile, Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation officials as saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian fleet of three short-haul aircraft.
Blair quoted in the El Mundo newspaper said that Pinochet's detention was unrelated to his government's so-called Ethical Foreign Policy, apparently ignoring pressure from leftists within his Labor party to support moves to prosecute the former dictator.``This is about two legal systems united by an extradition treaty but nobody seems to understand this,'' he said.The appeals argue that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international courts.
Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended 1990.Swiss authorities said the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should be given priority.
``Sometimes it should be made clear that crimes, wherever they take place, cannot be left unpunished,'' European Commission President Jacques Santer said.El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday.TV13 reported that the unidentified officer said Pinochet reacted calmly to the news imparted ``as one soldier to another.''
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil.``We stopped being a Spanish colony 188 years ago and we have no intention of becoming one again,'' he added.Government spokesman Josep Pique said Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar had no plans to meet the delegation, the state-owned news agency EFE reported.
``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday.Castro had just finished breakfast with King Juan Carlos of Spain in a city hotel.Although Chile maintained neutrality during the war, it was accused of providing military intelligence to the British.
''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back surgery.Chile argues that Pinochet must be released because as a senator he enjoys diplomatic immunity _ and because he is in poor health.In a separate attempt to block his extradition, lawyers for the former strongman went to court Friday to argue that British police acted illegally in accepting the Spanish warrant.
The prosecutor said he was asking the Swiss federal government to seek Pinochet's extradition from Britain to face trial in Geneva.In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts held by the general.The diplomatic and judicial entanglements that ensued now involve at least five governments.
``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so.''Aznar made similar comments when he meet journalists on the margin of a European Union summit in this Alpine lakeside resort.Aznar dismissed reports that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin America.
No arrests or injuries were reported.Any legal defense would be up to Pinochet's family.Pinochet has been widely accused of running a ruthless regime marked by disappearances and deaths of political opponents.
The 82-year-old Pinochet was arrested Friday at a Spanish magistrate's request.He remained Chilean army commander-in-chief until March.The magistrate broadened his charges Monday to include killings of Chileans as well as Spaniards, and genocide _ for which there is no diplomatic immunity.
The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power.The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament.Instead, she reiterated her demand for a government that would include Virtue.
Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in parliament, votes against him.``This is a plot and it can't be a reason for a resignation,'' Yilmaz said, adding that he intended to continue the ``struggle against organized crime.''
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.The opposition accuses Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of having ties to organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state bank.He denies the charges.
Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that they do not want a quick election.In a meeting this week the country's senior policy-making body, the National Security Council, in which military officers have a strong say, set three priorities for the coming months.He has translated the works of T.S.
After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate to the Turkish president.Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Deputies accused Yilmaz, who has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank.
The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez.Erez is supposed to talk Tuesday to center-right Tansu Ciller and to Deniz Baykal, who leads a center-left party.Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,'' he said in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion.Under his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States were tense.He has also expressed concern over a U.S.-led multinational force based in Turkey that monitors a no-fly zone over Kurdish
The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid.The government suspended the privatization last month after a lawmaker released an audio tape of a conversation supposedly between Yigit and mobster Alaattin Cakici.Turkey has requested his extradition.
Bulent Ecevit of the Democratic Left Party failed in a 3-week-old attempt to form a government that could command a majority of votes in Parliament.But Demirel broke with custom to keep the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party from power.Modern Turkey has had only one Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular traditions.
``I don't give up that easily, neither do I lose hope that easily,'' Ecevit told his parliamentary group Thursday.Ecevit was expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders Friday.Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.
I wanted to keep playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.''It didn't run off and get crazy like cancer can.''It's not going to be easy, but I think they're ready.
The Yankees came back to win the series, however; Knoblauch got a reprieve and talked about how much the experience had helped him.Quilvio Veras flied to right, Gwynn grounded out and Gomez took second, bringing Vaughn to the plate.It would not stay that way.
The very city that beat the Cubs for the 1969 eastern title held a parade for Sosa Saturday in the canyons where Lindbergh and John Glenn and the 1969 Mets were once hailed.``You want to win, but getting to the World Series is so tough after playing 162 games and getting into post-season and then having to fight, bite and scratch and everything else to get here.''While they're at it, the Yankees had better win the whole thing.
PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed.Ruben Rivera: An impatient hitter who will chase pitches out of the strike zone.Holds runners well.
``To have them act like that toward me was tremendous,'' said Knoblauch, about the response that he received.If the Yankees had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside the baseline.Now Knoblauch can watch television and read the newspapers again without getting queasy.
Free of worrying about his extremely uncertain future and an undisclosed personal matter that has made this post-season as perplexing as it has been pleasing.Still, it is an issue that hovers over the Yankees as ominously as the owner George Steinbrenner hovers over general manager Brian Cashman.``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality of trying to re-sign Williams.
The Padres set an attendance record of 2,555,901 this season, up a half-million from last year and nearly a million and a half from three years ago.``Their crowd seemed yuppified.Later, she brought her four children to Jack Murphy Stadium for the National League Padres when 2,500 people was a crowd.
New Yorkers are a boisterous, boastful bunch, and the patter of the city this week has been loud and arrogant, or so it must seem to anyone venturing here from San Diego to root for the Padres.Tino Martinez, the top run producer, has been in a numbing slump.Shane Spencer, the rookie slugging sensation of September, hasn't turned out to be the new Mr. October.
``Even though he made a mistake, you know you have the best out there,'' a baseball official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said.Budig, too, acknowledged that umpires, like players and managers, aren't perfect.A batted ball, Omar Vizquel's line drive, struck Hendry in Game 6.
It's easier to do that in post-season because your next at-bat could be the biggest at-bat of the season.''You have a bad series, you come back and have a great series.Right now, I've just got to be patient and wait.''
Delalic held up his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted by his family and then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him was planned.``This is the book of 500 pages in which it says 12 times Delalic is not guilty,'' he told reporters.Edina Residovic, Delalic's lawyer, said she will seek compensation for wrongful imprisonment on behalf of Delalic, who spent almost three years in confinement.
Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in cases where Serbs were the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics that fought wars for their secession.But Yugoslavia has questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia.``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' said Miodrag Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry.
All four defendants had faced up to life imprisonment, the maximum punishment at the tribunal, which has no death penalty.The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992.Yet a few witnesses also praised Delalic and Mucic for humanitarian gestures, such as getting food and clothing to some prisoners and releasing others.
``Srebrenica is a dark part of our history and people don't talk about it,'' the official said.Srebrenica was a key town in the Bosnian conflict.Under a deal pressed on Milosevic in October, the organization will provide up to 2,000 civilians to monitor a cease-fire in Kosovo and to promote a political settlement there to give Kosovo enhanced autonomy.
During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area.He was sentenced to 20 years by Karibi-Whyte, who denounced rape as ``a despicable act which strikes at the very core of human dignity and physical integrity.''Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing at least three others and was sentenced to 15 years.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command.During the trial _ the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses _ survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area.The 49-page indictment detailing atrocities at Celebici asserts that at least 14 prisoners were killed in 1992.
The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo.The Texas judge fired off the letter last Friday following the refusal of Belgrade authorities to allow tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour of Canada and a team of investigators to visit Kosovo.The tribunal wants to look into allegations of war crimes on both sides of the conflict.
Further, family members who survived the assault have described what they saw and the circumstances in the hills and valleys around Obrinje as the Serbs pushed forward early Saturday morning, Sept. 26, from their headquarters at Likovac, north of here.(To a lesser extent, Albanian guerrillas also attacked Serbian civilians, forcing them from their homes, and allegedly carried out at least two massacres.)He did not express direct remorse for allowing his family to use a hiding place so close to the family compound, which for all practical purposes was an informal base for 
``We will never be able to fix the exact number'' of victims, Bowers said.As the trial began, judges were read excerpts of a psychological report which stated that Jelisic was mentally fit to stand trial but suffered a ``borderline personality disorder.''``Quite to the contrary, the testimony will firmly establish that Goran Jelisic was an efficient and enthusiastic participant in the genocide.''
Jelisic, who was arrested in January by U.S. troops serving in the NATO force in Bosnia, has pleaded guilty to a total of 31 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.The charges cover the murders as well as three beatings and the plundering of property.An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal cell.
However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored plan for an Israeli pullback in the West Bank.Erekat said the Palestinians hope the four-day summit, set to begin Thursday outside the U.S. capital, would mark the end of a long round of meetings and the start of implementation of accords.At the table is a U.S plan for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent from the West Bank
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, is being considered for the government's No.The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace.The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri as asking, ``Does the Israeli government really want peace as it is trying to delude the world?''In a front page comment, Sahar Baasiri, said ``The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.''
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.
Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat.He commanded the legendary armored division that crossed and seized control of the Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since the 1982 invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular open-ended occupation of southern Lebanon, an operation with constant casualties among young inductees for which Sharon is still often blamed.
``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.But Netanyahu's government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed.Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message to all those who are deluding themselves _ and betting on Israel (to) change its anti-peace stand _ to give up their illusions,'' the paper said.
Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his strong-willed aide, a goal that has eluded other Israeli leaders.He still bears the burden of his role in the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Christian militiamen in Lebanon in 1982.That will be fine if Sharon is willing to play a constructive role in the peace talks himself.
The appointment ``is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin newspaper, which often speaks for the Syrian government.Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have been suspended for more than two years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli negotiations.An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said in a front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.''
Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were divided in their reactions, in similar ways.asked Uzi Benziman, an editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a critical biography of Sharon.``It will be just the settlers and some real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of public opinion.

Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed.Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated the report with six sources inside East Timor and said he had ``no reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement.
The Australian military holds joint training exercises with Indonesian troops, including the elite commando units accused ot atrocities in East Timor.``It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldiers,'' spokesman Jason McLeod said.``But we are demanding they be named along with their unit and battalion number because this will allow closer monitoring of human rights issues,'' he said.
Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to vote on whether to opt for independence or remain under Indonesian rule.The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a ``real and substantial reduction'' in troop levels and called for the establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor.The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule.
Opposition supporters alleged the incident Wednesday night was politically motivated.Eventually, the Foreign Ministry intervened and let Ramos-Horta enter Taiwan.Ramos-Horta was carrying a Portuguese passport, which should have permitted him visa-free entry to Taiwan for up to 14 days, newspapers said.
The Australian military holds joint training exercises with Indonesian troops, including the elite commando units accused ot atrocities in East Timor.``When they finally left the country the Australians distributed leaflets saying they would never forget the people of East Timor,'' he said.The United Nations refuses to recognize the annexation as legitimate; Australia is one of the few nations that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
But in a big step forward, he said, many separatist activists were no longer pressing for an immediate vote on independence.Talks were revived earlier this year after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto, but differences remain over a definition of autonomy that would suit all parties.``But I think there are ways of getting there and the first thing is to have peace and quiet.''
Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement, which cited resistance sources in East Timor's capital, Dili.The statement, released in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, also said that 22 people were injured and 26 were missing.The names, ages and occupations of the villagers were listed.
``The Portuguese delegation, without checking the truth of the information, decided to temporarily suspend the ongoing dialogue,'' Antara quoted Alatas as saying.However, it could not confirm claims that dozens of people had been killed.Before being suspended, the talks centered on an Indonesian offer to give East Timor autonomy in return for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty there.
There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or arrests as fighting between Muslims and Christians continued after dark, said a military officer who spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity.The Kupang riot broke out after thousands of Christians staged a peaceful strike and street protest against the Jakarta church attacks.Ismalil Hasan Metareum, head of the Muslim-dominated opposition United Development Party, urged his followers not to hit back.
The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.Placido dos Santos, a 28-year-old farmer, was tortured and killed by the Indonesian military during the attack, the statement claimed.The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta.
On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.Faced with mounting public criticism, Mahathir called Thursday for a probe by the attorney general of the alleged mistreatment of Anwar.The EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation.
``The police cannot harm their detainees in the course of their interrogation.''In a book about his six-month detention under the same law that kept Anwar away from family and lawyers for 10 days, Syed described being hit and deprived of sleep.CNBC refused to answer questions about its news gathering, said vice president of news programming Chris Blackman.
He created a national affirmative-action program that allowed the country's ethnic Chinese, Malays and Indians to share in improved living standards and a new sense of Malaysian identity and pride.But he has struck a harsh blow to the morale of his own nation, to the sense of confidence he had worked so hard to build under the slogan ``Malaysia Can!''Mahathir, says his former deputy, is ``senile'' and ``insane.''
The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system.After Anwar appeared in court with a black eye, bruised face, neck and arms, his case drew international attention, particularly from the presidents of the Philippines and Indonesia, who have raised the possibility they might not attend an 18-nation summit in Malaysia next month.Rafidah Aziz, the international trade and industry minister, and Tengku 
Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas corpus appeal that says the dissident politician is being unjustly held.He said the lawyers had asked the High Court for an early hearing on the request for Anwar's release.``There is no exodus from the party.''
So far Mahathir, 72, has designated three heirs-apparent during his 17-year rule.On Sept. 2, he fired the last one, Anwar Ibrahim, calling him morally unfit for office.``He appeared very good to me but he was actually planning ways of bringing me down.
He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President B.J.The Philippine leader said he was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
Although the government said police would ``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is ``impossible to control.''Among the hottest images now making the Internet rounds are several news-photo versions of Anwar's badly bruised eye, which he claims was inflicted by police during his first night of detention.``When you're in the opposition and you have no access to resources and media, then you end up making use of what's available to air your grouses,'' he 
Munawar Ahmad Aness, a friend and speech writer of Anwar Ibrahim, pleaded guilty to the charges last month, allegedly confessing to having sex with the political dissident.Aness, a Pakistani with permanent residence in the United States, was sentenced to six months in jail.That led to confusion whether Aness really wanted an appeal.
Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting.In a court appearance last week, Anwar's face was bruised and he said he had been beaten by police, heightening international attention to his case.Habibie said Anwar's dismissal should not have been based ``on things which had not been proven.''
He refused to answer questions about it, including where or when it was filmed and how or why the government had it.The four men, all wearing heavy beards, looked haggard.They were reportedly setting up a mobile phone network in Chechnya when they were abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29.Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said.Cochetel was unharmed, but he said three of the kidnappers had been killed.
``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told NTV.His release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.A Russian soldier taken hostage during the war was released Friday after a year of efforts to free him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency said.In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security officials.Chechnya considers itself an independent state, although no country, including Russia, has recognized its independence.
The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic.It was not known if Kennedy spoke under duress.The report gave no details of his release.
A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.``He was liberated on the border,'' Alexander Dzasokhov, the president of North Ossetia, told NTV.Dozens of people are currently held captive.
But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian media reports.``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and order in Chechnya since being elected last year.``Everything was going right, everyone was very optimistic'' that the hostages would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV.
But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian media reports.``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.``The people that have done this to him, they deserve exactly the same back.''
The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister.Van den Broek said the EU was determined to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed.The severed heads of the hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were found Tuesday.
He did not see any sign of the bodies.Chechen authorities had been searching for the missing men for the past two months.Hostage-takings, usually for ransom, have become common in Chechnya since the end of the breakaway republic's two-year war for independence from Russia in 1996.
``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks, he said.French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine met Sunday night with his British counterpart, 
Such a possibility raised the specter of a new Balkans conflict just three years after peace was secured in Bosnia.For that procedural breakthrough, Holbrooke recommended the lifting of a ban on foreign investment in Serbia that had been put in place the month before.That is in part, his domestic critics say, because diplomats like Holbrooke and the head of the U.N.refugee agency, Sadako Ogata, insist on going to see him, thus enhancing his stature.
At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire.Briefing reporters in Washington, Foley cited the absence of a formal cease-fire, the failure to arrange a meaningful dialogue with ethnic Albanian leaders and the continued presence of ``major army units'' in southeastern Kosovo near Albania's border.Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent 
Holbrooke spoke in Brussels, Belgium en route to Belgrade, where he planned to drive home to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic ``the extreme gravity of the situation.''``And I call on this parliament to conclude that Yugoslavia is faced with the imminent danger of war.He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province.
After delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over the Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said at a news conference that NATO's military plans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a ``serious, intense and sustained basis.''``It was not quite an ultimatum,'' the diplomat said, ``but more a matter of what steps have to be taken to show compliance.''Police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed off this time last week by the Yugoslav army are now open to the patrols of diplomatic monitors from the United States, European Union 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago.He plans to meet with the Kosovan Albanian leaders on Tuesday.``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' he said.
``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO leaders.In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come ``within days.''The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack.

Before boarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists.In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed concern that Milosevic was ``playing the classic game of making false promises'' to avoid NATO military strikes.Despite Annan's unwillingness to declare Serb noncompliance, U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said the Clinton administration believed Milosevic had not 
With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and claimed the government is taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo.``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' Solana said.In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``systematic terror'' had been inflicted on Kosovo civilians within recent days and that Yugoslav forces were mostly responsible.
Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence.However, interest rate levels had become a contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany and France pushing for rate cuts to help spur growth and combat unemployment, stuck at 10.9 percent in the nations adopting the euro.The cuts also boosted markets in Spain, Belgium, Italy and even Britain, which is not among the nations launching the euro
Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European Union members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should take part, according to a poll published Tuesday.Denmark is one of four EU countries staying out of the monetary union for the time being.Although many politicians support the unified currency, they have been wary about bringing the issue to voters again.
Setting a common interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone.It wasn't in response to political pressure,'' Tietmeyer said, referring to Germany's cut.``The coordinated rate cut could lead to a reduction in the current pessimism and a reduction in financial market turbulence,'' he said.
Foreign Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said, ``Paris is joining this alliance with the creation from January 1999 of a joint company.''Notes and coins _ the pocket money that shoppers and travelers will carry _ will be introduced only in 2002.Stock market officials in Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam and Brussels have indicated they would be interested in joining the London-Frankfurt alliance, which will initially create a single point of liquidity for trading in British and German blue-chip issues.
With the European Central Bank setting a common interest rate for the whole bloc, some economists fear the low rate designed to boost core EU economies like France and Germany may bring overheating in smaller nations with faster growth.There was good news for Greece which was kept out of the euro-zone for failing to meet economic conditions for joining, including low inflation.It's rate was 3.9 percent in November down from 5 percent a year before.
Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean.``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told France Info radio.On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will huddle at European Union headquarters to

The expected announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro accounts.``Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January 1, 1999,'' Xinhua reported.Chinese officials have said the government may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. 1 
``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question.The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the job.Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after four years of his eight year term although he has since said no such ``gentleman's agreement'' exists.
In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1.Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy.While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1 percent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in the 11 
He said the party's desertion of Prodi was ``wrong and dangerous,'' but at the same time promised to follow the party line.Once he does that, it is up to Scalfaro to decide what to do.It broke with Prodi over NATO expansion earlier this year and on sending troops into Albania last year.
It is autumn in Italy, the birds are going south, and so it seems could the Italian government, as the bonds of compromise and political opportunism that bind a small leftist party to the government came undone Sunday.On Sunday, Prodi's backers were still hoping that a sufficient number of Communist Refounding deputies would break ranks and back the budget when it comes up for a vote in Parliament later this week.But one of the leaders of that centrist group, Clemente Mastella, said Sunday that it would not support the 
Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western allies as a down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge.He struggled to the last to try to keep his original majority intact.Washington maintains that NATO does not need a new U.N. resolution to order a strike.
By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies.Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.The vote, 3rd graf prv
The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.``I'm not bitter,'' Prodi said immediately after his government went down.The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party.
Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments.The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber.MORE
``Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.''When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, the rank and file protested, and he was forced to backpedal.
By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.
But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.Armando Cossutta, leader of the moderate wing, resigned as party president Monday, saying the party's hardline stance was ``wrong and dangerous.''Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
If Scalfaro feels no candidate is capable of mustering a majority, he could call early elections.Despite help from a breakaway faction of the Communists, who on Sunday formed a new party, Prodi lost Friday's vote of confidence by a single vote.A government of technicians would get Italy through the volatile period of approving the 1999 budget and the launch of the common European currency, the euro, in January 1999.
In its suit, the government asserts that they are two separate products that Microsoft bundled together to get an unfair edge over its rival, Netscape Communications Corp., in the market for software used to browse the Internet's World Wide Web.The government's case focuses on an earlier deal in March 1996, when America Online chose Internet Explorer as its preferred browser; in that bargain Microsoft agreed to place a startup icon for the online service on the main Windows desktop screen _ the prime real estate in computing.The organization also 
In the wake of the lawsuit, Microsoft has voluntarily dropped some of these requirements, though it could reinstate them at will.The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers.In truth, though, neither case answered what consumer benefit test should apply to product design.
And since Microsoft itself makes all manner of software products beyond the operating system, other companies are put in the uneasy position of requiring Microsoft's cooperation to be able to compete against it.The Justice Department listened and investigated.We will always be in Microsoft's cross hairs.''
``The Sherman Act has always been an elastic piece of social legislation, used to attack perceived exploitation and the aggregation of power,'' said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University Law School.Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained about the company and the business practices of its founder, John D. Rockefeller.But during those years, the price of kerosene _ burned to light the nation's homes _declined steadily.
Browsers have the potential, like an operating system, to act as a software platform on which other programs run.Many antitrust experts say the problem facing the Justice Department is that the courts have provided no clear definition of tying and no clear guidelines for determining when contracts are illegally exclusionary.But perhaps Microsoft's best argument is that nowhere has the government identified a single case in which the courts explicitly called for throwing out a tied product on the basis of a balancing test.
The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft reflects the new evidence added to the case since May.``But the only thing that was wrapped up in a bow in time for the May filing was the browser,'' said one person who worked on the case.But Boies, who left Cravath last year, did not start working full-time for the Justice Department until mid-April, because he was still finishing private cases for his own firm, Boies &AMP; Schiller.
The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators.Once more, market forces overtook the investigation.In the meantime, last May the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys general filed their new suit against Microsoft, which is scheduled for trial on Monday.
Following is the text of the first two sections of the Sherman Act, as passed by Congress in 1890.As the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it.In the case of Microsoft, the government has invoked the Sherman Act to file a civil suit that seeks to change the company's business practices, not a criminal suit that seeks financial penalties
Avi Tevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness list in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft denies ever having made.The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive who led the development of Java, an Internet programming language that Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance of the software market.As a result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum, another two-week delay, even though ``a more normal schedule'' would have the trial 
``When you have a company with such a visible chief executive, the CEO is really the driver of the brand,'' said David Aaker, a brand marketing expert at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley.``There is no question this is going to affect Microsoft's brand recognition.''Indeed, there is evidence that the darker view of Gates and his company has so far taken root only in the District of Columbia and in Silicon Valley, where the computer industry has long felt the impact of Gates' tactics, 
Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey.A group of more than 100 Kurds began a three-day fast in a downtown Athens square Saturday in support of Ocalan.He must not be extradited to Turkey.''
Ocalan was arrested Thursday at the Rome airport as soon as he stepped off a plane from Moscow, where he had sought asylum after fleeing his hideout in Syria.In Italy, Dini told reporters in the city of Trento that the government would decide Ocalan's request for asylum in a ``clear and responsible manner.''In Istanbul, Turkish inmates at a prison took an Italian prisoner hostage to increase pressure for Ocalan's extradition.
``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out among the Kurdish demonstrators in Rome on Saturday.``To announce the results of an extradition trial that has not yet even begun does not go hand in hand with justice,'' Cem told reporters.Ocalan, a political science dropout from Ankara University, founded the Marxist-inspired PKK in 1978.
About 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit.Following his talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, Demirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and other senior officials.He was also to deliver a speech to the Foreign Policy Society later Tuesday.
Ocalan is being tried in absentia there on charges that could bring the death penalty.``We do not want someone who organizes terrorism in Italy,'' D'Alema said.``This is an opportunity to find an exit from a bloody conflict.''
Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday.The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey.In Rome, spokesmen for the PKK said Ocalan had carefully selected Italy because he felt there was sympathy there for his cause.
Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said.Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition.Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come from Germany.
There are some 4,000 Kurds living in Romania.Some 41 Kurds declared a hunger strike Monday to protest Ocalan's detention.The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe.

Qin Yongmin's latest run-in with the authorities came as he tried for the second time in a week to legally register a human rights monitoring group.Qin, detained briefly two weeks ago, was questioned for about three hours before being released and threatened with prosecution if he persisted in trying to set up his China Human Rights Observer.But even after China signs, the treaty would not come into force until ratified by the legislature, which may attach reservations effectively nullifying some provisions.
``We view his detention for peacefully exercising fundamental freedoms guaranteed by international human rights instruments as a serious step in the wrong direction,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington on Tuesday.China signed the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights with great fanfare in October, and Xu's arrest is seen by human rights groups as a test of the nation's commitment to its tenets.Three other Democratic Party organizers were also detained on Monday, although two of them were released early Wednesday.
``The Chinese government feels it expanded too quickly,'' Yao said at the airport, referring to his party.Dr. Wang Bingzhang, 50, an adviser to the overseas committee of the party, said later that Yao had left China for personal and political reasons.``They were scared all the time,'' he said, referring to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him.
With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident trials in two years.``Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I was doing this, some people were doing things to stop me,'' Hu Jiangxia said.It added that authorities violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have adequate representation.
The police officers who questioned An Jun said that without official permission, the group must cease its activities, the center said.Rampant official corruption is a major public gripe in China.The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports of graft in its first month of operation.
The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party.The father said he did not agree with his son's political tactics but now he felt he had no choice but to protest his treatment.He, too, has no defense lawyer.
Police in Hangzhou city notified Wang's wife Wednesday that charges have already been submitted to prosecutors, bringing him a step closer to trial, the Information Center said.In Washington on Wednesday, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the United States deplored the arrests and said the dissidents' peaceful political activities were fundamental human rights that all governments should protect.Zhu told reporters there was ``absolutely no contradiction at all'' between China's support for these treaties and its arrests of the two dissidents.
She added that police questioned the pair about the party as well as Qin's human rights monitoring organizations.Qin and Xu are towering figures in China's persecuted dissident community.``My husband is innocent and there's nothing he can be criticized for,'' said his wife, He Xintong.
The charges that Wang faces, in a trial that will almost certainly be secret and quick, could bring a sentence of five years or more.In 1993 he was put in a labor camp for two years.When President Clinton visited in the spring, Wang announced the formation of the Democracy Party.
The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers.He could face five years or more in prison.It will apparently be continued, said Qin's father, Qin Qingguo, since the session ended after the prosecution presented its charges.

Most of the victims were immigrants or of immigrant parentage, from countries including Iraq, Iran, Somalia, Ethiopia and current and former Yugoslavia.In the parking lot that a day before had been a tumult of ambulances and screams, mourners had laid a 30-meter-long (100-foot-long) pile of bouquets, candles and cards of remembrance.``I just wanted to show my sympathy.

Police said the dead or injured represented at least 19 nationalities, including Somalis, Ethiopians, Iraqis, Iranians and Swedes, along with people from current and former Yugoslavia and unspecified Latin American countries.Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities.``Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
Many escaped on their own.``Goteborg is today a city in shock.''Jamal Fawz, graf 19 pvs
He said he raced in and pulled to safety several people, including a friend.The cause of the fire was not immediately known.Anna-Lisa Saar, a social worker at Oestra Hospital, where many of the victims were taken, said identifying many of them was difficult.
Bent metal bars on some of the hall's windows showed the panic-fueled strength that the teen-agers, many of them immigrants, exerted as they sought ways out of the hall, which with some 400 people inside was crowded to more than twice its legal capacity.``I've been crying all day.``The identification is hard not only because of the burns but also because they have no driver's licenses or other documents _ they were so young,'' said Kerstin Einarsson of Sahlgrenska Hospital, the largest in the city of 435,000 some 500 
``The Turkish authorities fully know that measures had been taken in Syria and Lebanon more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the activities of any PKK member,'' Bweiz said at a news conference.The Lebanese press also accused Israel of inflaming the tensions.Meanwhile, Syria's Assad received messages of support from Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz and from the leaders of Yemen and Sudan, said Syria's official news agency, SANA.
Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million people, frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.Syria denies sheltering Kurdish fighters.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and Ankara.``We have taken steps to reassure Syria.''Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army to limit military maneuvers along Israel's border with Syria to avoid giving any impression Israel is poised to act.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey later this week.Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made the offer of mediation in a telephone conversation with his Syrian counterpart, Farouk al-Sharaa, on Sunday, said the paper, which is close to the Foreign Ministry.Syria denies the allegation.
President Elias Hrawi traveled to Damascus Monday for a summit meeting with President Hafez Assad to show Lebanon's support for Syria.Hariri said in an interview with An-Nahar daily that Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly forged military alliance with Israel.``The Turkish threats are the first outcome of the Turkish-Israeli strategic alliance,'' Hariri was quoted as saying.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.Moussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis.``The region cannot bear another conflict nor an increase in the present tensions,'' Babil said in an editorial.
Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and will dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday.Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad in Damascus and was expected to visit Turkey later this week.Syria denies the allegation.
``We will have to deal with these sources from their birth, because they may develop out of control and we will be led to tragic results.''Turkish troops have reportedly massed on the frontier with Syria, while Ankara has indicated its readiness for cross-border raids to eradicate what it claims are guerrilla bases harboring Kurdish rebels.Syria has denied the charge.
``Our patience has run out.Al-Sharaa said he hoped Mubarak's trip to Turkey this week would be fruitful.Syria and Turkey have a long history of disagreements.
The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being deployed.President Suleyman Demirel was harsher during parliament's opening session Thursday.``I declare to the world that we retain our right to counter Syria, which has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our warnings and peaceful approaches,'' he said.
A rebel defeat, on the other hand, would put the coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the Congolese army and opposition politicians on the defensive and give a boost to Kabila's efforts to fend off the rebellion launched Aug. 2.In Kinshasa, government spokesman Didier Mumengi said Monday the Congolese army was firmly in control of Kindu.The rebels are now using Kalima, a town with one main street, scattered houses and mud-and-brick huts, to supply troops with rice, cooking oil, drinking water and ammunition
Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday.It was the gunfire that alerted the soldiers, he said, adding that they killed two of the assailants.New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for Security Muruli Mukasa as saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain, 38 kilometers (24 miles) south of Juba, was destroyed last week when the SPLA took control.
The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers in Kabila's army and opposition politicians _ faced stiff resistance.The rebel victory would also open routes to Katanga and Eastern Kasai provinces, rich in copper and diamonds.The rebels accuse Kabila of betraying the eight-month rebellion that brought him to power in May 1997 through mismanagement and creating divisions among Congo's 400 tribes.
``Besides, the (Kabila) government has been using the Internet to tell their side of the story.''Since then, the rebels have been confined to a chunk of territory in the extreme eastern part of the country where their rebellion was declared Aug. 2.Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part of the media campaign.
The site _ www.prairienet.org/panafrican/cdm _ has been set up on the donor-supported Prairenet Community Network in eastern Illinois.Wamba said the rebels control 40 percent of Congo, an area of 15 million people.So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them of being the puppets of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda.
These reports could not be confirmed independently either.But the president has so far refused, accusing the rebels of being puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused of orchestrating the rebellion.The conflict in Central Africa has drawn in most of Congo's nine neighbors, and regional diplomatic initiatives have so far failed to stop it.
A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa.He said the government had been using the Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several days.Papaioannou, citing, 6th graf pvs
Rebels said the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition.Rebels, who began their insurgency more than two months ago, accuse President Laurent Kabila of corruption, failing to carry out promised democratic reforms, and stirring up hatred among Congo's 400 tribes.Early in the conflict, rebels pushed far into the west, to the outskirts of Congo's capital.
It was not possible to confirm independently either claim.The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes.The assistance was essential in routing an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts of Kinshasa in mid-August.
People are surviving on a sack of beans.In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan refugees engulfed Goma, a town of 30,000.He quickly changed the name of the country to Congo, from Zaire.
Previously, space officials have said the station would be jointly controlled from Moscow and Houston, with the U.S. space agency NASA taking a lead role.``Furthermore, Russian engineers are more experienced in this job and NASA officials are aware of this,'' he said.The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.
Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth.It will consist of more than 100 elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete.Russia rents the Baikonur launching pad from Kazakstan.
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday.Delaying the Nov. 20 flight by 10 hours to match the orbits would have forced similar shifts in the subsequent assembly flights, and resulted in potentially unfavorable sun angles on the solar-powered station, engineers said.``It added technical complexity and risks to the mission that were not justified.''
``That's terrific.''Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity.Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks.
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned, officials said.Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday 
1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity, the American-made side of the space station.Flight controllers urged caution.This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his 18-year NASA career, the most by an American, and the third for Newman.
The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya holds more than 6 tons of fuel in its 16 tanks and is capable of flying independently for 430 days.Russia has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for constructing the crew module, putting the whole project behind schedule.The project would allow Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
But because of all the partner nations trusting each other and working together, he said, ``the international space station is going to be a reality.''Even as the new space station is coming together, questions continue about the fate of Russia's existing space laboratory, the 12-year-old Mir.James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager of operations for the space station, said Friday that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending Mir's life.
We have margin on everything,'' said flight director Bob Castle.The smaller gap would have been ``probably a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said.Once completed, the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds, be longer than a football field, and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts.
``That's terrific.''It was slow going; she wanted and needed perfect alignment.Minutes after Zarya's capture, Cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as Russian flight controllers had feared.
