The smart money shouts that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs.The smart money insists that someone will cut a deal to end all this.In fact, the whole political culture of the 1990s, with its criminalization of political conduct and its seeming indifference to important national and international issues, has fallen into disrepute with ordinary Americans.
Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months.But Democrats said they were aghast, and many _ including Clinton _ called on Livingston to reconsider his decision.Livingston's announced resignation was all the more stunning for its disclosure in a process that could result in the president's removal from office.
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans, according to lawmakers who were present.The president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.
Listen to the American people.''Of his colleagues in the Senate, McHugh said, ``I, for one, would accept, even welcome, their mercy.''Let us disregard the people.
Sixty-seven votes would be required, and there are only 55 Republicans in the Senate, along with 45 Democrats.You say polls are against this.One Republican cited the parallels between the charges the House Judiciary Committee brought against Nixon 25 years ago, and the counts that the same committee brought to the House floor for affirmation on Saturday.
You resign!''declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should quit under fire.You resign!''
The evidence convinced most Americans that the president should be censured, but not removed from office.It must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming Senate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offenses against the law.Through cooperation, they can guide the Senate toward a punishment that fixes Clinton in history as a president who lied under oath, but avoids the taint of partisan vengeance associated with the House 
Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton.Flynt said earlier this year that he wanted to expose the ``hypocrisy'' of those in Washington who are investigating Clinton and in October offered $1 million to anyone who could prove they had had affairs with members of Congress.He spent some time Friday morning sprawled in a chair in the back of the House chamber, listening to the debate over whether to impeach Clinton for lying about his 
On Saturday morning, we had the surreal, shocking, bizarre, split-screen image of Bob Livingston, the speaker-elect, stepping down after his marital infidelities were revealed.What could be more relative than a Republican who has hidden a lot of affairs trying to impeach a president for lying about his?It might be a great time to see a lot of combovers, but it's not a great time to see a lot of stature.
The Republicans used Livingston's resignation to say that the president should resign, too; the Democrats immediately countered with the idea that the president would stay and that Livingston should as well.At noon, before the vote, CBS went to a football game, becoming the only network to leave the news coverage.He later announced impeachment votes on a split screen with the football game in progress in the upper part of the screen.
Two of the players, Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, play for Crystal Palace in the English First Division.Houghton also said that Yang, who plays in Frankfurt, ``very possibly could become an extremely important player in the national team,'' the newspaper reported.Li, who has not had many chances to play since his move to France, also ``is very willing to come back,'' the newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday.The plea to reconsider was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two, decade-old criminal cases involving their nationals: the theft of dlrs 20 million worth of jewels from a Saudi prince and the murder of three Saudi diplomats in Bangkok.
A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led to a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games.With the referee refusing to reverse his decision, Merchant sought help from the Indian team.With the addition of snooker, the Asian Games now have 36 sports.
Her medal ceremony immediately preceded the official opening festivities for two weeks of competition among 6,000 athletes from 41 nations.One, Sakchai Pungsrinon, a 30-year-old piping engineer, who paid 1,000 baht (dlrs 26) for his ceremonies ticket, said, ``Thailand has many problems.``The main target is the 2000 Olympics.''
Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday.``If the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participating countries, they still can compete,'' she said.There are 106 horses and 12 countries participating in the equestrian events.
Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team.``If there is any other reason behind this, such as the jewelry case and the murders, we will regret it very much because sports should be separated from politics,'' Kobsak said.They said they would consult with the council, which oversees the organization of the games, about the impact of the Saudi withdrawal.
Thailand showed its nearly complete facilities for the Asian Games to a tough jury Thursday _ the heads of the organizing committees from the 43 nations competing in the December event.Since the Thai organizers began their preparations, they have faced many difficulties, most of them resulting from the country's financial crisis, he said.``The games will be a success.''
Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported.Preparations for the games have been plagued by political interference by previous governments, alleged corruption and incompetence.The decision to award the contract for the sports complex was controversial, with critics calling it an attempt to bail out the property developer's failed housing estate.
Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday.Arrests were made throughout Bangkok during a four-day crackdown on panhandlers.The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20.
The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and ``night life ideas.''Indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at 10 p.m. before bedtime at the Asian Games village.A ``Traditional Thai Massage Parlor'' has been opened at the games' village.
Administration spokesmen have drawn a distinction between attempting to kill a specific person like bin Laden and attacking a group of people who command a terrorist organization.Bin Laden's organization was a significant concern for the Clinton administration even before the bombing of the U.S. embassies in East Africa.The review, by the National Security Council, was the basis for saying this operation did not violate the presidential order banning assassinations.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400.Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.
He was worried, he wrote in an angry dispatch, about the security of the ``East Africa network'' of bin Laden, the Saudi exile accused of masterminding a worldwide terrorist conspiracy against Americans.``They know that since Kenya was the main gateway for those members, there must be a center in Kenya,'' he wrote, concluding: ``We are really in danger.''Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to ``report periodically to bin Laden about the ``security'' situation 
The government has identified the aide in court papers with the pseudonym CS-1, saying the person pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a secret proceeding in U.S. district court in Manhattan.According to the government, the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere.From the court papers filed in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to federal 
And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls Enemy No.So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities.The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian intelligence service, as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent units to fight in Kosovo, the neighboring Serbian province.Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 after telling the government that he was head 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday.Mufti Abdul Hye and Manzoor Ahmed, editors at ``Jago Mujahid'' or ``Wake Up Mujahid,'' a monthy magazine published from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, were jailed for a month shortly after their arrest on Wednesday.They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security, the officer 
MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday.Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request.A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material.
The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul.He is a free man.''
U.S. officials say they have also received new reports of an increase in the Iraqi presence in Sudan since the missile attack.Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort.But Pendry denied that Idris owned any businesses with the Military Industrial Corp. U.S. intelligence officials declined to provide details about the reports of Idris' financial dealings with members of Islamic Jihad.
If Exxon and Mobil ultimately do combine, the costs could prove heaviest for energy industry employees.Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of New York.British Petroleum bought Standard Oil of Ohio in the 1970s, and Amoco was once Standard Oil of Indiana.
Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company.With mounting overtime that can stretch a shift to 16 hours or more, workers regularly make $55,000 or $65,000 a year.I still work for Mobil.''
Q. Mobil is the country's second-biggest oil company, behind Exxon.In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco.And when the Asian economies start growing again, that will lead to a good deal higher oil prices, say $20 a barrel, in the next 18 months.
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday.He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge.Ms. Jaffe said the proposed deal would provide each company with assets in areas where it had little influence.

Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth.But coming in the aftermath of the Shell-Texaco and BP-Amoco deals, a combination of Exxon and Mobil, which have significantly overlapping retail and refinery businesses in the United States and Europe, poses questions that antitrust officials have not confronted since the 1980s.
Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new high, the second of the week.It jumped 2.5 percent in the last five trading days.It was up 4.6 percent for the week.
Rather, it is among smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with stocks that again are near their peaks.If Exxon buys Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more than $140 billion _ off from April's peak of $244 billion but three times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling.Finally, he recommends National Presto Industries, a maker of housewares and electrical appliances, which is trading near $39, close

I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 12 months.
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday.Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares up sharply.Based on Mobil's $75.25 share price a week ago, a takeover of the company would be 
Robin Poke, a spokesman for the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), admitted it was unlikely the 33-year-old Charles could survive more than 24 hours at sea after being washed off Sword of Orion on Sunday night.AMSA spokesman David Gray said about 50 sailors had been winched to safety in this year's race.``There's just many, many injuries on those yachts that got knocked down.
Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet.We had John Quinn survive for 5 1-2 hours in 1993 and that was in the middle of the night in very severe conditions,'' Campbell said.A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew.
United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday.``She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody,'' Ellison said.Ellison says Sayonara can knock half a day off Morning Glory's record given the right conditions.

Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free himself from a safety harness.Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long Gray could survive in the water.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the missing vessels.Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor could survive in the water.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing.Race spokesman Peter Campbell said it was not known how long the sailor washed overboard could survive in the water.Despite the conditions, Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called off.
All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast.American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometers (30 miles) offshore while Marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore.While the annual event started in friendly and favorable northeasterly breezes, the 115-strong fleet reported cloudier conditions as it moved down the coast.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter, the center said.One of the missing yachts _ B-52 _ was found mid-morning Monday and was making its way toward Eden on the New South Wales coast, AusSAR said.
A major search was under way in Bass Strait off Australia's southeast coast on Sunday night for an injured crewman swept overboard during the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race.An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 13-meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had been rolled in the heavy seas, with several crewmen being injured, including the unidentified man lost overboard.A total of 37 yachts have been forced to retire from the 630-nautical-mile race, many having been dismasted or suffering injuries to crew.
Larry Bird, in the Indiana countryside or inside Boston Garden, was a luminous exception to the governing rule.Three years later, in a contract arbitration involving the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird.That's how Larry and Magic played, always dreaming of the special team.
Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games.``Last year, the players received about $1 billion dollars in salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement.And once it passes, then they'll negotiate.''
The players aren't going to get paid Nov. 15 in any circumstance,'' Hunter said.Hunter dismissed the league's latest proposal on Friday afternoon, then said both sides would be best served by awaiting Feerick's ruling.In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract.
If the figure was $29 million over the salary cap, then the 29 teams would work with a salary cap $1 million less than the previous season.Since the owners re-opened the current agreement because 57.1 percent of revenue was going toward salaries, the 63-percent figure would probably have to come down substantially for the owners to agree to such a proposal.``I'd like to think these our the last games we have to cancel,'' Granik said.
But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries.A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners.But Hunter disputed this notion, and in a conference call Friday talked openly about the entire season's being canceled before the players would back away from their ultimate goals.
Next week, it will consider canceling the first-ever regular season games in league history.Standing a few feet away from Ewing, he said, ``I hope the owners and commissioner have gotten the message: that we're serious about a deal.Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn.
The first substantive talks in more than two months between opposing sides of the National Basketball Association's labor dispute came and went Thursday without a hint of a settlement.``Whether's that 60 games, 50 games or 49 or 53, we're not there yet.No owners were present, but Granik, Commissioner David Stern and the league's lawyers spent most of the day explaining the intricacies of a two-week-old proposal to the players.

The number of players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, in NBA terms _ fell sharply.The courts could reject a union decertification vote as a sham, and in any case some players may fear that teams would feel free to offer less than the old union minimum.With that in mind, both owners and players may choose to battle on for months.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks against the installations.The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little to strengthen security at the embassy.The pattern of negligence demands examination by the Clinton administration and Congress.
Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.A federal prison official said Monday that the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts of violence and terrorism.''Young, the lawyer representing Odeh, said he was ``somewhat concerned because these are pretrial defendants, after all.''
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday.The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213 people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400.Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.
Government officials immediately announced that they were offering two rewards of $5 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of bin Laden and another man charged Wednesday, Muhammad Atef, who was described as bin Laden's chief military commander.While the June indictment against bin Laden suggested that the government had a great deal of knowledge of his dealings in the months before the embassy attacks, the new charges are an indication of how quickly the government has worked to solve the embassy attacks, which occurred just three months ago.
And that excuse is Osama bin Laden, the man Washington calls Enemy No.So far Saqib says he has no evidence of bin Laden's involvement in terrorist activities.The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.
German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday.The agency said it had received ``credible information'' that Middle East terrorists had stockpiled arms and explosives at the sites, but none were found.Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden is wanted by U.S. officials for those attacks.
He did not furnish second names for them, and it was not clear whether Ahmed was the same Egyptian charged in the Dar es Salaam bombing.A nearly simultaneous attack in neighboring Kenya killed 213 people, including 12 Americans, at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 7 that Ahmad Khalfan was a member of the group responsible for the bombing in Dar es

A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane.Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of three defendants in custody in Manhattan.In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while the third has been allowed to make only one 
The Taliban, who control about 90 percent of Afghanistan, on Friday closed their three-week inquiry into allegations that Osama bin Laden is waging a war of terror against the United States.``It's over, and America has not presented any evidence,'' Afghanistan's chief justice, Noor Mohammed Saqib, told The Associated Press in an interview at the Supreme Court building in the Afghan capital, Kabul.He is a free man.''
Money-lenders in rural Cambodia typically charge 100 percent interest, which must be paid in rice at harvest time, giving many farmers a handicapped start on the next crop season.``The poverty is getting worse right now and the situation with the malnutrition of children is a crisis,'' Davies said.In the 1998 budget, education was allocated 6.5 percent, health 4.4 percent and rural development 0.2 percent.
Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, denied reports in the South Korean press that the Chinese had disregarded requests for political asylum in forcing the refugees back across the border.He said they had crossed into China seeking food, not because of political repression in North Korea.
The South Korean government said it would not authorize a second shipment of cattle unless the North retracted its accusations.On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying that ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the dead cattle is cleared.''During his visit, Chung is expected to reach agreement on details of Hyundai's plan to start sightseeing tours of a scenic mountain in the North.
Heiberg likened the additives to ``cattle food'' and noted that doctors reported a rise in stomach illnesses from the mixtures.The Red Cross inspectors saw soldiers and people harvesting cabbage, the winter's main vegetable.The grain harvest is finished and by U.N. estimates little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people.
A North Korean man arrived in Seoul Wednesday and sought asylum after escaping his hunger-stricken homeland, government officials said.Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third country'' since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years, including 60 so far this year.
Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday.Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10 or 11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old.``A lot of the children were too weak to come to school,'' he said.
The study, the first scientific nutritional survey in North Korea, confirms the disturbing reports by international aid workers, who over the past year have gained increasing access to the population of this highly isolated and secretive country.While that 16 percent figure is not quite as bad as that of India and Bangladesh, the worst in the world with an 18 percent malnutrition rate, experts say that North Korea's number in some ways understates the problem.And while some have surmised that the closed counties might harbor pockets of death and devastation
Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and capacity to import food in the closed, communist nation.A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height.They measured the weight and height of 1,800 North Korean children from infants up to age seven in homes randomly selected in areas where aid agencies have access.
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.Some visitors with the United Nations and other organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago.While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected to add several million people, 
Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday.North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing.Chang said North Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said.Yeltsin was suffering from tracheobronchitis, had a fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 Fahrenheit) and was being treated with antibiotics, the president's doctors told the Interfax news agency.Yeltsin was to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going ahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev
During his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted on some of its debt.On Sunday, Yeltsin had been scheduled to lay wreaths at a monument to Alisher Naboi, an 16th century Uzbek poet, and salute an Uzbek honor guard, but both ceremonies were canceled.The two sides are expected to sign economic agreements Monday.
President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed that the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.''On Monday, ``the president didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant said, saying he called aides and spoke as though they were late for work at the Kremlin.
The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election.It has lost some of its urgency, as Yeltsin has grown physically and politically weaker and has said he will not run again.Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation.
Government sources said the president has also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were still going forward.Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations, the president's office said.``According to our constitution, the president himself has to say he is not able to work,'' Luzhkov said in an interview with the BBC in Moscow.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes.Moscow's NTV station said it was a crucial time for Russia, when ``presidential decisions'' are needed.
President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday.Asked about small bandages that were visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office said the president had sustained small burns.It did not say what had caused them.
President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday.Mrs. Yeltsin told the Argumenty i Fakty weekly that she hesitated even to touch on her husband's health ``when there is so much conjecture on this topic.''``I think we'll live like all normal people.
The issue was controversial earlier this year when Yeltsin refused to spell out his intentions and his aides insisted he had the legal right to seek re-election.Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation.``The president is a strong person, and he has been through far more difficult political situations,'' Mityukov said, according to Interfax.
The start of the meeting was shown on Russian television.The prime minister reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections.``It's time for him to step aside.''
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.But he sought to distance himself from the allegations by making a distinction between the actions of the bidding committee and the current organizing committee.``I hope we see a speedy resolution to Judge Mbaye's review.
members' votes for payments from bidding cities.The issue of vote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure of scholarship payments made to six relatives of IOC members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful bid to play host to the 2002 Winter Games.Hodler, 80, is one of only four IOC members with life membership because he was appointed before age limits were imposed in 1966.
Following is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: _ ``The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members _ as well as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions _ any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person.''
Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler.Samaranch said Hodler should have brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board.Samaranch expressed his respect and admiration for Hodler and ruled out the possbility of expelling him from the IOC, an option the Swiss member had raised.
Hodler has described as a ``bribe'' the dlrs 500,000 scholarship fund set up by Salt Lake which benefited the relatives of six IOC members.It also came as the former minister in charge of Sydney's 2000 Olympic bid revealed he was asked to offer bribes in exchange for votes.Hodler said the blame shud be on those ``who put pressure'' on Salt Lake to offer the scholarship funds.
Frank Joklik, president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, and SLOC senior vice president Dave Johnson appeared before the IOC panel for 90 minutes Friday night.Pound said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.''Pound declined to speculate on what _ if any _ sanctions could be taken against Salt Lake but did not rule out moving the games elsewhere.
The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games.Japan Olympic Committee has warned cities seeking to host the games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members excessively, the newspaper said.Eighty-eight IOC members took part in a secret vote in 1991 to decide who would host the 1998 games.

Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign.But maybe I will be expelled.The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities.
The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been ``muzzled'' by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization.Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet.He said he was told not to appear at a scheduled routine news conference.
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday.``We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project.
Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station.The most difficult part of Sunday's mating of the $240 million Zarya to the $300 million Unity was bringing them together after the shuttle caught up with the Russian unit.Unity, raised in Endeavour's cargo bay on Saturday, is so large that it blocked Currie's view of the mating fixtures from the shuttle's windows
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the moment the two pieces came together.It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the moment the two pieces came together.It will provide all of the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer.It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module.The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built station part.U.S. costs for construction, she added, were $24 billion, and for operations through the year 2012 were $10.4 billion, for a total of $34.4 billion.
But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, forcing a delay.NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians.By the time controllers traced the problem to a momentary drop in hydraulic pressure and decided to press ahead, it was too late _ they had missed the cutoff by 
Another attempt for Endeavour and its crew of six astronauts is scheduled for Friday at 3:36 a.m.``We want to err on the conservative side,'' Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy Space Center, said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the countdown just 19 seconds before liftoff.The show-stopper arose about four minutes before liftoff when the computer in the space shuttle set off a master alarm.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight.

Struggling to meet their fourth deadline over the federal budget, congressional Republicans and White House officials wrestled Tuesday with their differences over education, staging events to demonstrate support for what has become the most public and politically high-stakes element of the budget battle.Negotiators met into the night to hash out their disagreements over aid for schools, the census and contraceptives.And they also were split on how to conduct the census in the year 2000.
House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights.That provision would require a four-vote majority among the seven federal election commissioners every four years to retain the general counsel and staff director.The contraceptive measure is one of four related matters that have helped stall four spending bills.
Some conservative Republicans said they were concerned over the emerging shape of the final package, particularly elements dealing with family planning and emergency spending.And Democrats on Tuesday expressed concern over some White House positions, on issues like the census and an apparent compromise with Republicans on aid for farmers.But the fact that the two sides are finally talking about it now indicates that they are covering the full range of budget matters that need to be resolved.
The deal would put off until next March the contentious issue of whether the next census would use statistical sampling to supplement traditional methods of counting people.Bowles told the group of Democrats that the House Republicans were willing to give on a number of outstanding issues that were stalling final agreement on the budget, but that they were digging in their heels when it came to financing the census for six months.At Monday's meeting, the Democrats reminded administration officials that Clinton had promised that he would veto any legislation that restricted the Census 
This year, some members of Congress wanted to use the surplus for a big tax cut.Still others wanted to continue cutting government spending.Democrats wanted to raise taxes, especially on the rich, and protect social spending.
Three Republicans voted against the bill, and six Democrats voted for it.A Chafee aide said Chafee voted reluctantly for the road after Alaska's senators convinced him of its merits.``Building a road through a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how short or how long, would be the first time in the nation we have voted deliberately to authorize a road through a wilderness area,'' Bumpers said.
The talks came during another day of escalated political confrontation as congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully aware that they have three weeks until Election Day, tried to take advantage of the static budget situation.``What about the president?''Where is the president?
The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document.They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach him, and Republican leaders feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they might have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed.Still, he said he would probably support the bill.

Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers.The deal that President Clinton and Republican leaders hailed Thursday was a broad outline of areas of agreement on the final portion of the $1.7 trillion budget, not a written document.But several conservatives said that despite these problems, they expected to support the bill anyway.
Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish a state.Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in the West Bank.``Who invited President Clinton to the Gaza Strip?''
The radical Islamic group Hamas on Monday denounced U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to the Gaza Strip but carefully avoided making any threats against him.Hamas is, 2nd graf pvs
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence.They think they have the United States in their back pocket,'' said the Israeli leader.In the interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat stop threatening to declare independence on May 4, 1999, when the Palestinians maintain the Oslo accords expire.
Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction.Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank.With its demand, Israel may be setting itself up for a showdown with Clinton whose visit to Israel and the Palestinian is ushering in the next stage 
Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week.Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs
President Clinton will travel to Gaza next month to address Palestinian leaders, the White House said Friday.Clinton administration officials said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian soil with the trappings of a state visit.And during the talks in Maryland last month, Arafat agreed to call a meeting of the national council to ``reaffirm'' the decision to revoke the clauses.
Again, the Israeli leader accused the Palestinians of ignoring commitments in peace accords.Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told reporters during a picture-taking session with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that Israel ``has not left'' the Wye River agreement.Clinton's visit to Gaza and his address to the Palestinian National Council is seen by some as a boost for dreams of Palestinian statehood.
Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week.U.S. Secret Service agents have already arrived in Gaza to work with their Palestinian counterparts on how to protect Clinton during his first visit to Palestinian areas.Jabali said the APCs were part of a Palestinian security plan that has been presented to the Americans.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said he has ordered the Israeli army to deal with Palestinian riots with a ``firm hand.''Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked.On Thursday, 98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter.
Palestinian families struggle to keep alive the memories of fathers and brothers languishing in Israeli prisons, and chafe under the checkpoints and gunsights of Israeli troops.Clinton's foray to the Gaza Strip, which is already under Palestinian rule, will be the first by a sitting American president.In the mourning house in Abu Dis, though, the friends and relatives of Nasr Erekat had little to say about politics and statehood.
David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas.The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up in the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone call, the official said.The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack, because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled 
Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians.The decision came less than three hours after a car rigged with explosives blew up in an outdoor market in downtown Jersualem.The Palestinians say a vote is not required.
``He wanted to be a martyr in the cause of God.''When someone at home asked about the car he said nothing, and family members assumed it was one of the stolen vehicles often found here.``Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were talking together,'' said Sughayer's oldest brother, Ali, who worked with him past midnight at the produce store.
Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the new peace accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment.The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the market bombing and vowed more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.The family of Suleiman Musa Dahayneh, 24, said he had been married for three months to Zughayar's sister, Basma.
The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight.The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control.A Palestinian security official said several Islamic Holy War members were arrested in the West Bank on Friday 
A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21.``People started to shout `car on fire.'Hassan Asfour, a Palestinian peace negotiator, said the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack.
Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism.Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled all of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic militants.The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block the new peace accord.``This heroic operation is not the first and not going to be the last,'' the group said in a leaflet faxed to news organizations.``We refuse any political agreement that would recognize the Zionist enemy.''

At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.Next to the wreckage lay a completely charred body with stumps of arms and legs _ apparently that of the bomber.Shlomo Meir, a black-clad Orthodox Jew, was standing nearby when he heard a blast.
One national television channel turned over its daylong programming to funeral coverage and a memorial tribute.Her political party, Russia's Democratic Choice, called on all Russians to turn out their lights in her memory for three minutes at 8 p.m. Tuesday.It was not clear whether the shooting was related to Starovoitova's death.
The lawmaker's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a ``clear'' mind Monday, testifying to investigators, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of parliament, were the most likely culprits.Seleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000, denied the newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an ``outright slander.''
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said.A neighbor found the body in a pool of blood late Friday night and called an ambulance, they said.The Interfax news agency said her aide, Ruslan Linkov, was also seriously injured.
As outrage mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova was not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics.Television news since her death has carried reports of little else.There was, in much of the reaction to Starovoitova's death, the sense that a line had been crossed.

A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said.Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide, Ruslan Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported.A police spokesman in St. Petersburg would not comment on the report.
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said.It gave no other details.There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg in recent months.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 23: The Russian reform movement has produced few leaders with an uncompromising dedication to democracy.Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia.In a bleak season of economic collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence.
Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated.An aide was also shot and critically wounded.More than 200 people gathered in St. Petersburg's Palace Square to remember Starovoitova.
Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered Sunday outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina Staravoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, Mrs. Staravoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with gunshot wounds to the head and neck.``To kill a woman _ a woman in politics _ that has not happened in Russia since Stalin's time.''
The last time George Voinovich ran for office, he won re-election as Ohio's governor with 72 percent of the vote, stunning even his most optimistic supporters and setting a 20th-century record for victory margins in Ohio politics.``He promised to be the education governor,'' said Ms. Boyle.Also, Voinovich, a former lieutenant governor, has been on statewide ballots five times over the last 20 years and thus is the better-known candidate.
He did so Friday at a series of fund-raisers.Lower-income Democratic voters, he said, might not bother to vote in a typical election.What should be at issue, Clinton said, are his achievements and agenda and the Republicans' record, which he described harshly.
However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers are instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office.``The speaker's office,'' says Nancy.``This is the speaker's office.''
Against that complicated backdrop, the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race, state to state and week to week, depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate.D'Amato responded to questions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants have been suggesting to their candidates.Schumer's media adviser, Hank Morris, seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue.
Labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board.Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees International Union, which has 350,000 members in New York State.Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato the last time he ran either _ announced the endorsements during the founding convention of the

In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal.But in Indianapolis, Gary Hofmeister, a conservative jeweler challenging Mrs. Carson in Indiana's 10th Congressional District, is taking a more subtle approach: rather than mention the scandal directly, he notes as 
The measure, a nonbinding resolution, was brought to the floor by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill.Most of these matters have little chance of finding their way into law, but members hope to turn them to their advantage on Election Day.But some Democrats are close enough to Republican leaders, and to Republican goals, that their measures are taken seriously.

Many of those calling for government help were once themselves subjects of FBI interest as anti-war and civil rights activists.Violence at abortion clinics is only part of the problem.``We shouldn't investigate groups.''
Federal authorities investigating the murder of a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions have identified a Vermont man as a material witness to the sniper attack last month and issued a warrant for his arrest Wednesday to bring him in for questioning.Kopp, according to police records and abortion rights groups, has often moved about the country in a series of protests at abortion clinics, and has been linked to an underground manual that describes methods of killing or maiming doctors who perform abortions.Law enforcement officials said that the unit's operation did 
There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses.Many women's clinics have tightened security, and doctors who provide abortions have been urged to take precautions.Abortion was illegal in Canada until 1988.
And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day of Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into jail.But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that Kopp may help provide such a link.Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo.
Buffalo has been among a handful of hot spots for abortion protesters for the last decade.But their perch outside the clinic means they witness far more of what they believe are murders than what they call rescues.Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, said she identified with the clinic patients.
On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994.The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James Charles Kopp, who is 
The slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian in his home last week eliminated the mainstay of the only abortion clinic here, but it has not eliminated women's access to abortion.A 1994 Guttmacher study, the last one published, found that the number had decreased 18 percent between 1982 and 1992, to 2,380 from 2,908.But the lack of training programs is also a result of political pressures on hospitals and universities by antagonists of abortion and the same climate of fear.
But during a stay that lasted several months, he was arrested on Federal charges of blocking access to a Rochester health clinic where abortions were performed.Abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn.Members of the Lambs of Christ and other opponents of abortion in Rochester wonder whether the killing of Slepian will hinder their efforts.
But Slepian was far from either.He made few friends, but those he had were friends for life.Slepian.''
The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of increasingly abrasive protests at abortion clinics.While he was in an Atlanta jail, Kopp was given the nickname Atomic Dog, which investigators contend links him to the violent fringe of the anti-abortion movement, responsible for a series of bombings and arsons and seven murders of abortion providers 
Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize.They were given the prize for their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system, according to the citiation from the Karolinska lnstitute.The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year.
Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday.Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula.Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country and he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language ``more visible and audible.''
``I'm not the only one who deserved it'', said the first Portuguese-language author to obtain the prestigious award.``I wasn't born to win the Nobel.I didn't have my own books until I was 18.''
In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12, the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt.
This year's winner _ or, possibly, winners _ will be announced Thursday, the Academy disclosed Tuesday.Bloom's U.S. favorites include Cormac McCarthy, author of ``Blood Meridian''; Philip Roth, author of ``American Pastoral''; and John Ashbery, ``the best living poet.''Two of the past three were poets _ does that favor a prose writer?
Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm.A member of the Portuguese Communist Party since 1969, he served as editor of a Lisbon newspaper, Diario de Noticias, during an 18-month period when the left looked likely to seize power in Portugal.When the novel was published 
When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters.A new chapter in the mystery will be written Thursday, when the Swedish Academy announces this year's winner of the world's most prestigious prize for writers.Nobel's will says the prize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.''
Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence.Furchgott is a pharmacologist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn, Ignarro is at University of California-Los Angeles and Murad is at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.The medicine prize was the second of the six Nobels to be announced this year.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for nominations.However, the five-member Norwegian awards committee also wanted to honor Carter for brokering the pact, only to be foiled by their own rules.Lundestad said the committee, which works in deep secrecy in its five or six meetings a year, tried to find a loophole in the rules, which are overseen by the Swedish Nobel Foundation
Scientists are trying to develop drugs that can block production of nitric oxide in such infections.Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels.Murad showed that a gas could regulate important cellular functions and studied how nitroglycerin and related heart drugs led to the release of nitric oxide.
What many the world over consider democracy is legally subversive in China for threatening the Communist Party-led system.In the past month, authorities have arrested and convicted Xu, Qin and Wang and detained or interrogated at least 29 other party members.Police took Zha from his home Sunday afternoon and held him for nearly 24 hours to keep him from Xu's trial.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.''His visit has drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners.
In the speech, reported by state television, Jiang said stability was crucial over the next year.By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trampled its own legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about its commitments to U.N. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 months.``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock'' over the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang and the recent detentions of several other Chinese, the four wrote in a letter dated Tuesday that was released by 
Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences.He said the harsh prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the Communists.On human rights, I just don't think there's much more 
He is the third and most influential leader in the China Democracy Party tried in a three-week campaign that has seen at least 32 members detained or questioned.Authorities released Liu on medical parole five months before the end of his sentence provided he go abroad, said his brother, exiled democracy campaigner Liu Qing.In a sign of the opposition party's appeal, 205 dissidents from across China issued a petition Sunday calling for the immediate release of Xu and two other leaders, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human 
In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political party.His colleague in the China Democracy Party, Wang Youcai, was sentenced to 11 years, in a verdict announced by a court in Hangzhou four days after his trial.Xu's daughter also criticized the verdict.
Monday's sentences, which came just six months after President Clinton's visit to Beijing, where he publicly challenged China's leaders to move quickly toward political reform, were harshly criticized by the State Department.His wife, who until Monday had not been allowed to contact him since his arrest on Nov. 30, was told three days ago.Xu's wife refused to meet the lawyer before the trial.
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed.``The reaction of Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release.``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China recently signed

Although pleased that Liu Nianchun was free, human rights groups decried the Chinese government's timing as manipulative.Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing.Liu Nianchun, 50, has been in ill-health for at least two years.
The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy.Washington does not favor more direct aid.``In the long run, the gap between Russia's needs and its resources must be met not by foreign bailouts but by foreign investment.''
Even that strategy may backfire, however, because discontent over Yeltsin does not necessarily translate into support for his predecessors.``All the slogans are aimed against the president and the economic course of the country.``This is mainly a general expression of a great wave of distrust of authorities, mainly the president.
Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks.Deputies voted 240-47 to prepare a revised version of the decree and debate it later in the month.They must consider the decree by Oct. 10, or else it automatically takes effect under the constitution.
The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago.The state Railway Ministry complains that it is continually stiffed by customers who believe the railroads are honor-bound to carry freight whether they are paid or not.The government has specified nearly 40 categories of freight which the railroads must carry for next to nothing.
``You've seen the tension almost every day,'' one senior World Bank official said recently.When Japan used the last IMF meeting to propose setting up a $100 billion ``Asia Fund'' _ one that would exclude the United States and would probably offer aid under much more relaxed conditions than the IMF does.``Not this year.''
Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows for the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down 5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent.Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage point on Tuesday.``It is affecting Wall Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.''
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman said Friday.Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko and Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov flew to Washington on Friday for negotiations with the IMF over the dlrs 4.3 billion installment.But Primakov said that the country's plan would be dependent on the IMF loan, not the other way around.
Kuchma did not elaborate in his comments to a group of Ukrainian economists, saying only that the changes were necessary because of the country's economic problems.The Russian crisis has hurt bilateral trade, caused the Ukrainian currency to fall and led to a withdrawal of investors from Ukraine.The hryvna has been trading at 3.4 to the dollar in recent days but trading has been limited.
But, he said, the government would take steps to staunch the flow of dollars from Russia.Russian companies stashed about dlrs 2.5 billion outside the country in September alone, the Interfax news agency reported Friday, quoting central bank figures.``We are very much interested in foreign investments, especially in ones that go into the real production sector,'' Primakov said, according to Interfax.
Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday.Not surprisingly Maslyukov's plan calls for a greater state role in the economy, including controls on hard currency.Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country.
The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim.Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada.Estrada has expressed support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month.
After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim.Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the meeting of the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month in the Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar.Indonesian President B.J.
``We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness of the reform packages that we see being proposed in front of your government today,'' said business council chairman George David, who is also chairman and CEO of United Technologies Corp. Thailand was hit hard by last year's Asian economic crisis, and the proposed economic reform legislation focuses on resolving the massive bad debt of private companies, which is hindering a recovery.It's very impressive,'' David said, adding that Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda promised Parliament would pass reform 
But he fired his protege from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he was morally unfit to lead.He was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting.Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates and a risk to national security.
Malaysia's foreign reserves rose strongly in September, and there is anecdotal evidence that consumers are starting to spend again.Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy.``The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go wrong in the global economy,'' Yusof said.
Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to restore stability.The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote regional economic stability.The worsening financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at next week's summit in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said.Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an 
Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years, was driven out of power by a violent, pro-democracy movement, and the world's fourth most populous country is in real trouble financially.The trial will be interrupted during the Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States.So far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial crisis.
The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.Pacific Rim leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, will sample local dishes at a luncheon planned for the end of their two-day summit.It's expected to be a hot affair.
Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday.``I'm very concerned over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted as saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation.He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
But in a week when candlelight vigils for Shepard were being held on campuses across the nation, the scarecrow incident highlighted how hostility toward gay people often flourishes in high schools and universities, gay leaders said Tuesday.Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the past year.On Monday, hours after Shepard's death, 
On hearing of the protest, the Casper City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night and unanimously passed an ordinance banning protests during funerals.Touching people of all walks of life, Shepard's murder has elicited calls for tolerance of homosexuals from unexpected quarters.``But I guess God wanted his parents to be with him.''
But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier.``He indicated he was gay, and they said they were gay, too.''Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents today that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck.

Police said Henderson and McKinney lured Shepard from the bar by saying they too were gay and one of their girlfriends said Shepard had embarassed one of the men by making a pass at him.``Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.''With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped and severely beaten, died here Monday, five days after he was found unconscious on a Wyoming ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing temperatures.``Matthew's death may lead to an awakening in Wyoming and in the United States Congress as the need for this legislation.''With hate crimes, the violence becomes an unstoppable goal,'' Levin said.
On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington.Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threatened a group of 
Turley, who is gay and said he only came out after he had left Wyoming, said that he immediately complained to the museum.On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where Shepard was being treated.President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday, ``I was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against Matthew Shepard.''
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua.That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, Bolanos said.
Hurricane Mitch cut through the Honduran coast like a ripsaw Thursday, its devastating winds whirling for a third day through resort islands and mainland communities.Hurricane-force winds whirled up to 30 miles (50 kilometers) from the center, with rain-laden tropical storm winds extending well beyond that.Eight others died in Nicaragua in flooding.
The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement.Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000 people have died in the region.Guatemala reported 100 storm-related deaths.
As of Thursday, Mitch had killed 6,076 people in Honduras _ down from officials' earlier estimate of 7,000.``We have more access to places affected by the storm,'' Urbizo explained.Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 475 soldiers to help in relief operations.
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people.Mitch was drifting west at only 2 mph (3 kph) over the Bay Islands, Honduras' most popular tourist area.It also was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms
The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country's central coast.``Honduras doesn't have them.''The strongest hurricane to hit Honduras in recent memory was Fifi in 1974, which ravaged Honduras' Caribbean coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering.Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction and death.''Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies have been overwhelmed.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs
In Honduras, at least 231 deaths have been blamed on Mitch, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes.Mexico reported one death from Mitch last Monday.
Residents feared more children would die.U.S. President Bill Clinton requested a ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million.Taiwan said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932.``We've got to reach out and have more than southern white males running the Washington Republican Party,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida.At the White House, Clinton called the election results a vindication of his party's policies.
Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority party and turned it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority.The speaker was right to say this was ``not the election we expected.''Winning control of Congress after so many years was very tough for Gingrich in 1994.
President Clinton called it an ``astonishing'' triumph of issues over investigations and said the Democrats had won so many major victories ``because they had a clear message.''In a referendum in 1996, California adopted a primary system under which Republicans, Democrats and independent voters would all receive the same ballot, with candidates of all parties listed.Gore will have what he needs, as will Bush, Forbes and former Gov.

Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida.At the White House, Clinton called the election results a vindication of his party's policies.
Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January.In his second conference call, according to several people who listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.According to another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of his resignation: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the members.
Livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions, possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined if he could win.But, these officials said that if Livingston did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for speaker instead.``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.''
Even if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him.Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker.The officials said that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous election returns but also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the

Joe Scarborough, a conservative from Florida.At the White House, Clinton called the election results a vindication of his party's policies.
But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision seems to have blurred this time around, costing Republicans a net of five seats in Tuesday's election and leaving the party's narrow governing majority even narrower.Members and aides said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year.``Newt's gone out of his way to support the moderates.
A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled.Not only that, but Carville went beyond his customary denunciations of Gingrich and the Republicans and, in an interview, trained his fire on leaders in his own party for not being sufficiently aggressive four weeks before Election Day.Asked to describe the Democrats' strategy for the election, 
de Klerk, in human rights abuses after he threatened a court challenge.De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday.``All we are doing is postponing dealing with the matter,'' Tutu later told The Associated Press.
A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday.The ANC, which led the struggle against white rule and now is in power, previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.The Truth and Reconciliation Commission will release its final report on 2 1-2 years of investigation on Thursday.
Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W.Some political analysts said Wednesday's events would only further the belief that the panel lacks impartiality.``He is very happy to be in the courts now rather than dealing with the Truth Commission,'' Steward said.
Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society.``We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation as a whole,'' he said.De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes.
Drawing from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution to the healing process.But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world has seen, and South Africa is the better for it.
The disagreement stems from Thursday's release of the report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on horrors committed during apartheid.Rather than act as a salve and an aid to reconciliation, the report has caused divisiveness, even among former comrades-in-arms who fought apartheid.Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires _ took a hard line Saturday against the report, and indicated all ANC members must do the same.
Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters.Madikizela-Mandela has not sought amnesty.The commission found her accountable for human rights violations committed by her bodyguards, who the report said killed and tortured suspected opponents.
INKATHA The Commission finds that in 1986, the South African Defense Forces (S.A.D.F.)The Commission finds furthermore that the deployment of the paramilitary unit in KwaZulu led to gross violations of human rights, including killing, attempted killing and severe ill treatment.The commission does not condone the legitimization of such individuals as military targets and finds that the extrajudicial killings of such individuals constituted gross violations of human rights.
The deal that South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission offered was simple enough: Confess your crimes, apply for amnesty and you will go free.If you don't come forward, you will be prosecuted.During the talks, the white National Party government pushed for a blanket amnesty, and the ANC refused.
The 3,500-page report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission culminates more than two years of nationwide hearings.South African media released preliminary findings on Monday, three days before its official release on Thursday in Pretoria, the capital.``I do expect various responses (to the report).
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported.The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three years.The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently visited in December 1997.
Britain would like to see the two suspects in custody by Dec. 21, the 10th anniversary of the Pan Am bombing.The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects.
Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported.The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed in a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister in a tent.Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie case,'' the television said
Annan spoke to reporters in the Libyan capital of Tripoli after the meeting and again later when he arrived back at this Tunisian island, where he had begun his 15-hour stretch of diplomacy.Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two suspects.But a disagreement has arisen because Libya wants the suspects jailed in the Netherlands or Libya if convicted, but the United States and Britain insist they be imprisoned in Scotland.
Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday he was extending his North African tour to include talks with Libyan authorities.Annan's trip to Tunisia is scheduled to end Friday, according to the official program.The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 270 people.
``We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show the truth ... and that it is held without a political or security background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said.But the hand over of the suspects has been held up over Libya's demand for a guarantee that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in Libya.``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional trial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term in Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' 
Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according to Scottish law and using Scottish judges.Libya wants them jailed in the Netherlands or Libya, but the United States and Britain say they should be imprisoned in Scotland and refuse to negotiate the issue.

Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial system.The Group of Seven is composed of the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.Protecting their economies from the spreading economic turmoil, which is affecting more countries than at any time since the early 1980s, is key to world economic stability, he said.
The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion.So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected $170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further.The Chinese _ besieged by floods, deeply troubled state-owned industries and an incipient banking crisis 
``The problem is that none of the candidates in Sunday's elections ... wants to be identified with unpopular austerity measures,'' said Kugelmas.Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plans.``If Maluf wins, he will use his victory as a launching pad to the presidency in 2003,'' Kugelmas predicted.
But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home.In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion.Roriz hasn't explained where the money would come from.
Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global financial crisis.Not since the early 1980s have so many countries been in recession, and the crisis now threatens to cripple Latin America's developing economies.An early arrival, Cuban President Fidel Castro, described the turmoil in world financial markets as the most important issue facing the world at the moment.
Other administration officials say they believe that there would be few objections in Congress to direct U.S. participation in a Brazil bailout.U.S. officials said that South Korea did not need the extra help, and that the collapse of the Suharto government in Indonesia so changed the political scene there that it would be too risky to offer direct U.S. aid.The first deputy managing director for the International Monetary Fund, Stanley Fischer, spent Friday in Brazil to review the country's austerity plan, which is expected to be announced after Sunday's elections 
Caught in the middle of an economic crisis, many Brazilian factories fear they won't be able to pay their workers the mandatory year-end bonus.So they're considering paying with products instead of cash.For union leader Felicio, the proposed product-for-cash swap ``is a clear sign of the despair the business sector is feeling because of the recessive economic policies'' brought by the Real Plan, the economic stabilization program put together in 1994 when Cardoso was finance minister.
In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years.Throughout the day, government officials met with Cardoso in Brasilia and were expected to fine-tune a three-year austerity package that Cardoso was to discuss with congressional party leaders on Wednesday morning.It had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting in Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would have to reach a primary account surplus 
But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home.The savings at the palace could come to nearly dlrs 145,000 (170,000 reals) a month, said Nilson Rebello, chief administrator of the president's office.In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion (1.2 billion reals).
A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000.Both organizations as well as private banks are expected to contribute to the rescue package.Brazil has lost about dlrs 25 billion in foreign currency reserves since August when Russia defaulted on its debts and sparked a new crisis of confidence in emerging market countries.
Uncompromising enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC President Prince Norodom Ranariddh agreed Nov. 13 to form a government at a summit convened by Sihanouk.The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls illegal.Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members' return an international issue.The U.N. secretary-general's representative office in Phnom Penh provided monitors to opposition politicians after they returned to Cambodia to 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.The king has powers to grant pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically sensitive cases.
The prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said such a scenario was unconstitutional.``Co-sharing anything with the CPP means surrendering full power to them.Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make an ``appropriate concession'' to break the deadlock over forming a government.
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations.Ranariddh and his core supporters did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in July this year that the ruling party narrowly won.The 
After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said.Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 24 opening of parliament
Sam Rainsy and the 14 members of parliament from his party have been holed up overseas for two months.But a deal reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their return.``I think Hun Sen has got everything.
In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises to end the stalemate: ``Papa would like to ask all three parties to take responsibility before the nation and the people.''Hun Sen used Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with his party.Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations.
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia.Hun Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians' safety and their right to conduct political activities 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' the political crisis.Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed.Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely 
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor.Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post.``Historically, we do not approve that a military man takes control of the country,'' Jumblatt told reporters after a meeting with outgoing President Elias Hrawi.He told reporters that Lahoud will ``keep the army out of politics just as he kept politics out of the army.''
The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon.``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir.In another formality before the election, the Parliament will amend the constitution, which forbids senior public servants from running for president.
He demanded that Lahoud admit that he acted unconstitutionally by allowing 31 Parliament deputies to authorize him to name a prime minister instead of naming one themselves.Lahoud on Monday set the stage for choosing a new prime minister when he scheduled a fresh round of consultations with Parliament for Tuesday and Wednesday.In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultations.

A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri.Under a formula aimed at preventing the recurrence of the 1975-90 civil war, power in Lebanon is shared equally by a Maronite Christian president, a Sunni Muslim prime minister and a Shiite Parliament speaker.Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three times during the extended term of former President Elias Hrawi.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army after it disintegrated in the civil war.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula.President Kim Dae-jung, appearing with Clinton at a news conference, pledged that his government would ``spare no effort in supporting the U.S. endeavor'' to resolve the nuclear question.Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground 
But, speaking at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had ``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors.But he said he hoped there would be ``no backsliding'' in Indonesia.In describing the leaders' conversation, Berger called restructuring the chaebols ``perhaps the most serious remaining problem in the South Korean economy.''
This city has always kept an unwritten list of foreign leaders _ dictators, unfriendly authoritarians and consistently annoying allies _ who it thinks can make an enormous contribution to peace, security or America's agenda by taking early retirement, at a minimum.But Mahathir is no Saddam, not by a long shot.Yet Washington has never called on the starving North Koreans to revolt against Kim's repressive regime.
A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared.At the time, North Korea was believed to have made enough plutonium for one or two atomic bombs.North Korea has said the underground construction is for civilian use and not nuclear-related.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula.He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop missiles.The North Koreans have denied the underground construction site has any nuclear purpose, and have proposed a dlrs 300 million payment for allowing inspections.
North Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspections comes to blows.The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.The general staff of the North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the situation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections and talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and 
North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, the State Department said on Wednesday.The official North Korean press agency said last week that the government was building ``civilian underground structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that American officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they pressed for access.``We are beginning a discussion with them in which we will demand access,
The United States rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government delegation.The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United States could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering and defaming my country.''Administration officials say Perry is being asked to study ways to salvage the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea, which had 
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years.Some visitors with the United Nations and other organizations have said that the food situation seems to be a bit better now than a year or two ago.While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean that North Korea's population, after eight years in which it had been expected to add several million people,

The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business.AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time.

The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman.The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates' credibility.''The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail, though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape.
Nor have Internet service providers and other telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the highly specific customized services that big corporate clients demand.Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services.This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 214.72 points, or 2.34 percent, to 9,374.27.The record is the first since July 17, when the Dow closed at 9,337.97.Netscape was the most active stock Monday, gaining 2}, to 41 15/16.

Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems.On Friday and Monday, Lacovara repeatedly pointed out that other companies are placing other operating systems on the market, and some software companies _ principally Microsoft's greatest rivals _ are writing software for these new systems.
In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had ``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in Microsoft's cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce.The Netscape transformation was largely a reaction to Microsoft's competitive assault on its browser business _ a central element 
The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25: America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields.But it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the dominant player in software.In its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the federal government charges that the company has illegally bundled its own browser with its Windows operating system to smother 
America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company _ the Internet media business and electronic commerce.AOL, according to executives close to the proposed deal, will own Netscape, but it will have a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun.By combining Sun's technology prowess with AOL's powerful consumer brand, the Sun executives say, there is the potential for a kind end-run around Microsoft's grip on desktop computing.
Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights.Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport.Travel is expected to become easier once a land route between the West Bank and Gaza opens next month.
Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport.All flights, which must be approved by Israel in advance, would not be allowed to fly over Israeli airspace.``It may be a landing site for President Clinton, but we're not confirming,'' said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni.``The Transportation Minister asked me to tell the Palestinians that if this continues, we won't allow the airport operate,'' he told The Associated Press.Gen. Fayez Zeidan.
Israeli airport security officials were not available for comment.He said such differences did not undermine the peace process.Since Wye, Israel has accused the Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence, and has frozen the accords.
Amid a flurry of last minute preparations, the young Palestinian Authority prepared Thursday for a milestone on the road to maturity: its very own airport.Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport.And all flights, which must be approved by Israel in advance, would not be allowed to fly over their airspace.

The control tower is still without controls, the check-in counter has no computers and the runway can't function after dark for lack of flood lights.The airport opening had been held up for two years because of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo.Degani, from the Israeli military government, said some equipment was being held up by customs.
The first Palestinian commercial flight landed at Amman's Marka Airport on Saturday, inaugurating an air route between Jordan and the autonomous Gaza Strip.The Falcon F-50 short-haul plane carried 48 passengers, mostly Palestinian businessmen and students.The plane will return later in the day.
``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday.Public prosecutors from Spain's National Court have appealed the judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant.The appeals argue that crimes committed during Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship are none of Spain's business, and should be left to the Chilean or international courts.
The Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank accounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman said Wednesday.Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland.Pinochet has been held at a London clinic since his arrest earlier this month.
El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday.El Mundo reported that the family had asked police guards to stand outside the former dictator's room and keep out of sight.Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday.
Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.Espina also warned that the issue was damaging relations between Chile Spain and Britain.On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery.
``It seems to me that what has happened there (in London) is universal meddling,'' Castro told reporters covering the Ibero-American summit being held here Sunday.Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit being held here.
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide.''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back surgery.'I would like to ask for compassion for a person who is very, very, very, ill.'' Pinochet, 82, had surgery Oct. 9 for a herniated disc, a painful spinal disorder which 
As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.In London, where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen.In London, British officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the 
The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities and they will not interfere.``Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar.``I've avoided commenting on that judicial process and I don't intend to do so.''
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous.British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.According to a Chilean government report, a total of 4,299 political opponents died or disappeared during Pinochet's term.
``She regarded it as a private meeting,'' said Mark Worthington, spokesman for the Lady Thatcher, Conservative Party prime minister from 1979-90.Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status.``We are not protecting the dictator of the '70s,'' Artaza said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Tuesday.
The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue, the largest party in parliament.Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday.Ecevit already has the support of her arch-rival, outgoing Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party.
Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster.Yilmaz' minority government could go down if the the small, center-left Republican Party, which usually gives him the majority he needs in parliament, votes against him.The leader of the Republicans, Deniz Baykal, urged Yilmaz to resign.
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal.If approved, the legislature will debate the motions on Monday and hold the no-confidence vote Wednesday.He denies the charges.
Military commanders, who hold ultimate power in Turkey, have quietly told senior political figures, including Demirel, that they do not want a quick election.The commanders are also hoping to exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, neither of whom they trust, from posts in the new government.Ecevit must now try to build a government that includes their center-right parties but not them as individuals.
After failing to bring together political rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that he was returning his mandate to the Turkish president.Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Such a cabinet would not have to face a confidence vote.
Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles.Erez opened talks with various party leaders on Monday.He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing.
Ecevit, who was prime minister three times since 1974, has over the years shed some of the socialist idealism he was known for in the 70s.Under his leadership in the 70's, ties with the United States were tense.He was barred from politics in the years that followed a 1980 military coup.
Two opposition parties threatened to press for a motion to censure the government.The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid.Yigit said the premier had also encouraged him to buy mass-circulation national newspaper Milliyet, apparently to ensure the paper's backing to his center-right Motherland party in elections next year.
Only center-right leader Tansu Ciller said she wanted a government led by a party leader, and made clear she was willing to take on the task.Modern Turkey has had only one Islamic-led government, formed after 1995 elections, and the military pressured it from power for failing to stick to the country's secular traditions.Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government.
Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition.Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party.Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.
I wanted to keep playing because I knew we were going to get into the World Series.''``I wanted to be there because that's what you play for,'' said Strawberry.Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me.
The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand slam.One out into the seventh, however, Jorge Posada hit a single, and Brown walked Ricky Ledee.The Yankees had taken a 2-0 lead over Brown in the second inning, forcing him to throw 32 pitches in the second.
``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so I can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night.Now that the Yankees are in the Series, their Florida-based owner and their fans and they themselves can see nothing more appropriate than four more victories.You want to get to the World Series.
The Yankees could use a contribution from Jorge Posada, who will start in Games 1 and 2 and may get a chance to drive pitches low in the strike zone, where he can hit with power.PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he's hitting right-handed, jam him with fastballs when he's batting left-handed.He can hit with power if you make a 
But it surely made Knoblauch feel at home when he realized that the fans had forgiven him.He did not look up, but continued to talk about how he had learned a lot by being vilified after making a mistake that Little Leaguers are expected not to make.I let them back into the game, and that would have been a tough one if they would have come back and beat us.
``It's a tough thing,'' Cashman said about balancing the excitement of being in the World Series with the reality of trying to re-sign Williams.When Williams was asked what better situation could a player have than being the center fielder for the Yankees, winning a batting crown and being in the World Series, the 30-year-old was stumped.While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams as much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous

The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport.Baseball fans, even Yankee fans, can spend a lifetime waiting to see a home team of historic caliber, and this Yankee team will not reach that sanctified status unless it ends its record-setting season by winning the World Series.The curious thing about this team,

Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic.Delalic held up his verdict as he arrived and was first greeted by his family and then by many friends from Konjic, 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of Sarajevo, where a huge welcome party for him was planned.``More important is that acts commited by some weren't ordered by officers of our Bosnian Army.
Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday.``The indicted who are not in The Hague are at-large because of the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities to arrest and extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of the American Bar Association.But Yugoslavia has questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.Inmates at the Celebici prison camp were beaten to death by guards wielding baseball bats, wooden planks and rifle butts, according to testimony.The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing 
American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment.He is considered a close associate of the Bosnian Serb commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, and the former Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, both of whom are wanted by the tribunal.It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, when the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of trucks to the surrounded town and promised the Bosnian Muslims 
Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing at least three others and was sentenced to 15 years.Mucic also was cleared of responsibility for four murders and three cases of mistreatment or torture of prisoners.The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992.

The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo.In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.''``The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council and all law-abiding nations,
``Blood was in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, who returned in uniform to discover the bodies.Later in the month, the body of Hajriz was found pushed down a well, close to the ravine.Delijaj family members have told Human Rights Watch monitors and others that they saw an ethnic Albanian police officer accompanying the Serbian police officers during the fighting.
Jelisic pleaded guilty in October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in and around the Serb-run Luka camp set up in Brcko, northern Bosnia, in May 1992.``To victims in Brcko, the face of genocide was the face of Goran Jelisic,'' he said.Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide.U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified himself to prisoners as the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, and bragged about the number of Muslims he had killed.Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape and torture, but it has yet 
A senior Palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative.Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat met Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan in Amman Monday to brief him on talks with U.S. officials on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations with Israel.However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday, was balking at agreeing to an American-authored plan 
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.Sharon, who opposes ceding West Bank land to the Palestinians, is being considered for the government's No.Netanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister since the post was vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's hardline negotiating strategy with the Palestinians.
In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace.Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat.As defense minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts.At 70, Sharon remains one of the great polarizing fixtures of Israeli political life.
Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.
The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister.The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed.If Sharon ever hopes to overcome the shame of Sabra and Shatila, he must 
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a ``disaster'' for peace.An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said in a front-page comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.''
``Arik Sharon is the most fitting person in the state of Israel for the position of foreign minister,'' Netanyahu said, using his nickname.``Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign ministry and negotiating with the Palestinians?''Netanyahu said.

Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.Roque Rodrigues, a Lisbon spokesman for the National Council of Timorese Resistance, another pro-independence group, said he had corroborated the report with six sources inside East Timor and said he had ``no reasons to doubt the truth'' of the statement.The half-island territory lies some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southeast of Jakarta
Protesters on Sunday urged Australian military leaders to identify Indonesian army officers trained here to allow closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor.``It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldiers,'' spokesman Jason McLeod said.The protesters wanted Australia to cut all military ties with Indonesia despite Defence Minister John Moore's recent announcement that joint exercises would resume, he said.
In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975.``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end summit.Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the East Timorese to 
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry on Thursday blamed ``administrative negligence'' for an incident in which Nobel Peace Prize winner Josi Ramos-Horta was left stranded at the airport for hours after being refused entry.But Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August, leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night, ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference.The only countries that don't allow me in would be countries

``They don't want independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor.``I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it,'' said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations.Marker was scheduled to talk with Indonesian President B.J.
Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others.The report could not be independently confirmed, and Indonesian officials were not immediately available for comment.The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.
Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops.Alatas said it was the third time that Portugal had unilaterally suspended talks over East Timor since 1986.Meanwhile, about 500 students ended their noisy but peaceful rally outside the office of East Timor's governor in Dili Tuesday after receiving promises that the reported killings would be investigated.
Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.The violence in the Christian-dominated city of Kupang was in retaliation for the burning and ransacking of 22 churches by Muslim mobs in the capital, Jakarta, on Nov. 22, when 14 people were killed.Adurrahman Wahid, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim grouping, the 30 million-member Nahdlatul Ulama,

Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations.The EU statement welcomed the opening of this investigation.``The EU expresses hope that the other political demonstrators still detained under the Internal Security Act will also be released soon,'' the statement said.
Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of Malaysian police.Anwar's bruises raise ``alarming questions about the state of governance in the country,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the opposition Democratic Action Party.On Thursday she was summoned for the third time to police headquarters for questioning about an interview with regional television network CNBC Asia.
Unlike in Indonesia, there has been little evidence of a simmering discontent in Malaysia.Malaysia is not familiar with political demonstrations.People here whisper that Mahathir's days may now be numbered.
But he fired his protege from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister on grounds he was morally unfit to lead.He was expected to return to Kuala Lumpur later Tuesday to chair the UMNO meeting.Under the same law, police also arrested 17 people considered Anwar associates and a risk to national security.
Lawyers for the prime minister's former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went to court Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite detention.``I pleaded with the police to allow the children to see their father,'' she told reporters at the courthouse.Despite the recent protests against him, Prime Minister Mahathir said Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and there have been no defections from the party, which claims a membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million.
Another challenged Mahathir for leadership of the ruling party, and lost.Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward toppling him as prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National Organization.At first, I did not believe when people told me about this, but I now know this to be true,'' said Mahathir.
Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy.``Frankly speaking there is no reason to say that just because one man was arrested for something ... that it should bring any unrest,'' trade minister Rafidah Aziz said.The Philippine leader said he was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
Deprived of a voice in state-controlled newspapers and television, supporters of Malaysia's jailed opposition leader have turned to the Internet to air their views.Although the government said police would ``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is ``impossible to control.''Malaysian journalist M.G.G.
In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers.We have instructions to proceed and we are proceeding,'' said Singh, adding he filed the letter of appeal in court Sept. 29.Between the visits with his client, however, Aness signed another letter saying he would not proceed with the appeal, Singh said.
Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday.``I'm very concerned over how my friend Anwar Ibrahim has been treated,'' Habibie was quoted as saying by the English-language newspaper The Nation.He then began speaking out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British spies.The government has said it was trying to rescue the men at the time of their deaths, which have outraged Britain and Russia.In the tape, Kennedy claimed they were using the equipment to monitor phone calls.
A French United Nations official who was kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago was set free Saturday and flown to U.N. headquarters in Geneva.Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said.Two security officers were slightly injured during the operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus.It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia.
In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security officials.It did not say how many people are killed.Chechnya considers itself an independent state, although no country, including Russia, has recognized its independence.
Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday.Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.Only a handful of soldiers kidnapped during the war are still in captivity.

Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander.The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.``He was just making a career for himself,'' Hickey's sister Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting back tears.

The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister.In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless killing of the four hostages.''Van den Broek said the EU was determined to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed.
Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia.But Chechen government officials at the scene said four bodies had been found without giving further details.Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been recovered.
On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.The conflict has killed hundreds _ most of them Albanian civilians _ and left more than 275,000 refugees.The government said Friday that the fighting had ended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who are fighting for independence for the Serbian province.
All along, the biggest fear in Washington has been that the Kosovo conflict would engulf neighboring countries and encourage Albania and the ethnic Albanian population in Macedonia to join the cause.Clinton administration officials said at the time that they were concerned that NATO intervention would bolster the separatist forces.A British reporter who walked across fields into the village on Sunday said about 10 mortar shells, apparently from the Serbian police or the Yugoslav army, were fired at the village early Sunday afternoon.
Before boarding a plane for Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists.At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav forces had increased their attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians even after a U.N. resolution demanded a cease-fire.Meanwhile, Yugoslavia's prime minister told an emergency session of parliament Monday that the country ``is faced with the imminent 
Meanwhile, the head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, called on Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack.Djukanovic, a staunch Milosevic critic, called on the Yugoslav president to address the nation ``with an unambiguous message'' that he has accepted all U.N. resolutions and agreements he made with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.A Western diplomat said up to 120 Yugoslav army armored vehicles, including tanks, have been pulled out.
The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack.The Yugoslav leader added that ``for more than seven days there have been no skirmishes or military action.''These monitors, many of whom are former military officers, have reported that the Yugoslav army has ``stood down'' and that they have seen virtually no military action since late last week.
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago.Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation'' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday.Speaking after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark, Holbrooke said ``while the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there.''
In Berlin, German Gen. Dieter Stoeckmann told German radio that NATO action could come ``within days.''He said five of the 10 special police units had been removed from Kosovo and the others had been returned to barracks in the province.The head of Yugoslavia's other republic, Montenegro, on Monday urged Milosevic to accept all international demands and avert a NATO attack.
``While the level of fighting (in Kosovo) may have abated temporarily, the capacity for its resumption is there,'' Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and Supreme Allied Commander Europe Wesley K. Clark.However, Ivanov and Sergeyev said the airstrikes could occur ``if decisive measures are not immediately taken for a radical improvement of the situation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the ITAR-Tass news agency.To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security 
With NATO attacks said to be only days away, top U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke delivered a last-minute warning Monday to Yugoslavia's president to halt his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or face airstrikes.Before boarding a plane for the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, however, Holbrooke said conditions in the southern Serbian province had not improved since the alliance started two weeks ago to finalize plans for air raids to force Milosevic to halt his offensive against Kosovo Albanian separatists.At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Yugoslav 
With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the ``imminent danger of war'' and claimed the government is taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo.But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters that the Alliance believed Yugoslavia had not yet met the conditions demanded by the U.N. Security Council.``The reality coming to us is that the compliance is not yet in place,'' Solana said.
It is expected to drop to the common rate by the time the euro is launched.Until recently, Europe's economies had held out relatively well against damage from Asia and Russia's economic crises and unstable financial markets.The rate cuts may help.
The poll, conducted Dec. 18-22, was broadcast by TV2 channel.Danish voters traditionally have been lukewarm supporters of the EU.A poll published last October showed 46 percent of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed.
The coordinated move was a key step in preparing for economic union.In Germany, the biggest economy in the future euro-zone, central bankers cut the key interest rate to 3 percent from 3.3 percent.But Tietmeyer, head of the bank on which the ECB is modeled, promised that the rate cut does not signal the start of a volatile monetary policy.
Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the precursor of a pan-European market.The London exchange estimates that a pan-European stock exchange would group together companies with a market capitalization of $5.5 trillion, compared with $8.7 trillion on the New York Stock Exchange.A spokeswoman said officials from the London Stock 
The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday.Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg are set to adopt the euro as a common currency at midnight on New Year's Eve.Eurostat gave the following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 
Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean.The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II.``This Dec. 31, 1998, will be one of the great dates in the history of the 20th century,'' French

China made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization for the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealings starting Jan. 1.The expected announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro accounts.Chinese officials have said the government may convert a proportion of its dlrs 145 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves into the euro after the currency's Jan. 1 debut.
Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed.``I had hoped you wouldn't ask me that question.The answer is no,'' Duisenberg told the Le Monde daily, which had asked him if he would step down after four years on the job.
In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1.Despite an area-wide survey that suggested ``a moderation in the pace of growth,'' Duisenberg said domestic demand will continue to boost the economy.He pointed also to a gradual improvement in labor market conditions as supporting growth, as well as interest-rate cuts toward the 3.3 percent level of the euro-zone
Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support.``We are in a very complicated political crisis which could lead to early elections,'' Cossutta told reporters Monday.Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they would stand to gain by early elections, including the Communist Refoundation.
The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition.A rate cut by the Italian central bank is generally thought to hinge on passage of the budget bill.In June, the hard-line leftists again refused to follow the prime minister, that time in a Parliament vote for NATO expansion, but the government muddled through with the help of 
In his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading Parliament to approve NATO strikes.``They have won by the treachery of one single person,'' Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party.Prodi has often said he would not govern with any other majority than the center-left one that elected him in 1996.
By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies.Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.The vote, 3rd graf prv
By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign.President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro must now decide whether to call early elections or to ask Prodi or someone else to try to forge a new majority.The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor.
Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments.Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support.The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber.
A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority in Parliament.Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the coalition.Or he could seek to form a new majority without the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small center-right party of Francesco Cossiga.

Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week.But the break with Prodi's government divided Refoundation.Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government.Following the talks, which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority.He could also name a new premier, or appoint a government of technocrats.
To cite one example, Microsoft contends that its industry-standard Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer browser are a single integrated product.In ``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle with Microsoft,'' the authors, Michael A. Cusumano of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management and David B. Yoffie of the Harvard business school, quote a Microsoft executive as saying that only with the third version of Microsoft's browser was it integrated with Windows.But you can't say, `Oh
The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another.The Supreme Court ruled that Aspen Skiing had violated antitrust laws because there was no evidence its action helped consumers.Here, too, the Supreme Court ruled that the exclusionary practice did nothing to benefit consumers.
And we're asking them: `What is your business?Intel's main business is making the microprocessor chips that act as the electronic brains of most of the computers that run the Windows operating system.But in June 1996, when Compaq wanted to offer the Netscape product instead of Microsoft's browser, most industry experts viewed the browser and operating system as two different software programs.
Economists at the time opposed the Sherman Act, and the law that Congress passed was a vaguely worded compromise.Throughout the 1880s and '90s, Standard Oil's rivals had complained about the company and the business practices of its founder, John D. Rockefeller.Both were dominant companies of their day, and Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, has been called a modern Rockefeller.

In the June ruling, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product.But mostly it strengthened the hand of those within the Justice Department who had been urging that the case be broadened, according to people who have worked on the investigation.The Justice Department and the states filed their suit in May to move before Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, was introduced in June.
The government's antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft, the world's largest independent software company, has spanned Republican and Democratic administrations and involved hundreds of government lawyers and investigators.In interviews, more than a dozen current and former senior antitrust officials _ whether friends of the government or of Microsoft _ all say the Justice Department's antitrust suit is a natural outgrowth of the previous investigations.In answer to a question during a news conference in May, just before the suit was filed, Clinton said: ``I have taken the view that 
As the foundation on which federal antitrust law has been built, the act has been amended several times _ elevating the crime to a felony, increasing the fines and prison terms for individuals and setting fines for corporations convicted of violating it.Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal.Section 2.
To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, a senior Microsoft executive who has worked with Sun, and Chris Engstrom, an executive who handled some of Microsoft's dealings with Apple.The Justice Department, Warden told the judge, was ``trying to turn this into something approximating a plenary monopoly case like the IBM case.''Instead he entered an order setting the Oct. 19 trial date.
Two weeks ago, while speaking before a crowd of almost 7,000 students at Indiana University, a questioner who asked about the Justice Department's suit was roundly booed.1 or a threat to the known universe?And that was just Week One of the trial.
Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey.But Greek government officials have stressed support for Kurdish self-determination.Within hours of the PKK leader's arrest, Turkey requested his extradition to face a number of terrorism-related charges, which could carry the death penalty.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.''``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling of brawls that broke out during the first day of protests Saturday outside the Rome military hospital.He criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly said Italy would deny Turkey's extradition request.
Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.''If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital.Before leaving, he criticized an Italian Justice Ministry official, who reportedly said Turkey's extradition request would be refused.
About 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit.President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place during Austria's European Union presidency.``The political situation requires comprehensive security measures,'' the Austria Press Agency quoted Walter Zehetmayr, a senior police officer, as saying.
Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey.But D'Alema, a former Communist who was appointed prime minister last month, is under pressure from leftists in his coalition to offer Ocalan political asylum.He noted that Italian law prohibits extradition of suspects to countries that have the death penalty.
The movement turned to armed struggle in 1984, mainly focusing on guerrilla-style warfare in the southeast, but also carrying out bomb attacks on civilians in western Turkey.The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to attack it.There is a fair amount of sympathy for the Kurds in Europe, and if the movement gains political momentum, Turkey could come under more pressure from its western allies to grant the Kurds minority rights.
INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials said Monday.Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said.Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come from Germany.
Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday.Kurdish business leaders said the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported.There are some 4,000 Kurds living in Romania.
Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage Sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man.Demircioglu said Calascibetta's extradition would now be delayed by a few days.
About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow.He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday.Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.''His visit has drawn appeals from dissidents and an international press freedom group urging him to persuade Chinese leaders to free political prisoners.
The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington.Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in Wuhan on Monday.Three other Democratic Party 
The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China.``They were scared all the time,'' he said, referring to Yao's wife, Yu Yingzhang, and daughter, Yao Yiting, 14, who accompanied him.Ms. Laroche said the Yao brothers, especially the younger man, won prominence by helping to finance predecessors of the China Democracy Party with money from the family business 
Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among the most active and influential members of China's dissident community.Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin Xiaoguang said.Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for fair trials, the Information Center said.
Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday.The Information Center said Corruption Watch had already received reports of graft in its first month of operation.In a separate report, the center said that an official in the Sichuan provincial government refused Thursday to accept an application by three dissidents to form a branch of a would-be opposition group, the China Democracy Party.
He, too, has no defense lawyer.As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced its charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China.Wang now faces charges that could land him in prison for five years or more.
The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against them and Wang were the sharpest action Chinese leaders have taken since dissidents began pushing to set up and legally register the China Democracy Party in June.Xu and Qin were ``suspected of involvement in activities endangering state security'' and their ``behavior breached relevant provisions of the criminal laws of the People's Republic of China,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly briefing.It was the 17th international human rights treaty China has signed.
China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday.On Wednesday, 190 dissidents from around the country demanded in an open letter that the government release Xu, Qin and Wang Youcai, saying the arrests run counter to U.N. human rights treaties China has signed over the past 14 months.Qin.''
One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given to his wife on Monday.On that day two prominent dissidents, both promoters of the new party, were detained.Qin was imprisoned for eight years.
The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session for just two hours and 10 minutes.The elderly father's request to the court Thursday morning for a postponement was ignored, so he and one of the defendant's brothers stayed outside the court building in protest, leaving another brother inside.``We didn't feel there was any reason to observe the trial because if Qin Yongmin did not have a defense attorney, then as far as 
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155.Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.``The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' said Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening.''The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish and that, combined with noise and the caller's distress, delayed the fire squads' response by several minutes.He and other officials declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victims.The hall was packed far beyond its capacity.
The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building, had in turn rented the facility out to another person for the dance, Carlsson said.Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people inside.Goteborg has about 435,000 people.
A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday.He and other officials declined to comment on whether a quicker response could have saved any of the mostly immigrant victims.By showing up, he said, he wanted to show the victims' relatives and friends that spirit can help them pull through despair.

I'm alive, so why should I sleep when my friends are dead,'' 17-year-old Alina Turk said as she stood outside the ruined building Friday afternoon.No police.Although Hersi, like many of the youths at the dance, believes the police and firemen were slow, authorities said the first fire trucks were on the scene within five minutes of getting the alarm.
Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday hat Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.Hariri said Turkey's military moves were the product of its newly forged military alliance with Israel.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on the trip, said before their departure that Mubarak ``backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power and threats.''Turkey long has accused Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey.
Signaling it does not want to be involved in any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey, Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with Syria.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also stressed Israel's hands-off approach to the escalating dispute between Damascus and Ankara.``We have no part in this tension,'' Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday.
Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels.Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday that Turkey would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Monday there were no Kurdish rebels based in his country.

Greece accused Turkey of undermining the whole region's stability through its stand-off with Syria over the alleged harboring of Kurdish rebels.Relations between Greece and neighboring Turkey are rarely cordial.But as neighbors, countries in the region must learn to get along, Reppas stressed.
As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria.Some 10,000 Turkish troops were deployed this week on the Turkish-Syrian border, news reports said.Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria.
Turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its southeastern border with Syria amid growing tensions between the two neighbors, newspapers reported Thursday.The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being deployed.Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied any troop movement along the border, but said Turkey's patience was running out.
Since the assault on the town began at 3 a.m. (0100 GMT), at least 18 enemy soldiers were killed and 40 taken prisoner, Mondo said, adding the number was expected to rise.He said the large Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) outside town, was deserted and no one appeared to be in control.``Our soldiers are in the town and the fighting is continuing,'' rebel battalion commander Arthur Mulunda said in Kalima, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu.
Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday.The attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital Kampala, said the spokesman, who identified himself only as Lt. Majera.He said the rebels likely fled back to their bases after the attack.
It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops.On Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at Kalima, a small town 80 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Kindu, serving as a rear base for the attack.In Kinshasa, the Ministry of Defense said Tuesday that the Congolese Armed Forces, known as the FAC, had killed 18 rebels in warding 
Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet.Posting the rebel mission statement on the Internet is just part of the media campaign.Well, I'm not a Tutsi,'' Wamba said.

``We're in the town and the airport,'' Ngangura said.Also on Sunday, Ngangura said the rebels took Bumba, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Kisangani.These reports could not be confirmed independently either.
A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of the capital, Kinshasa.Neither claim could be confirmed independently.He said the plane was shot down while approaching Kindu air base, where the rebels had deployed at least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final assault on the government-held town.
Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said surface-to-air missiles in the arsenal of his Congolese Democratic Coalition had prevented the government from landing aircraft at the airport.He said government troops did not launch a counterattack to Sunday's barrage, and some reportedly retreated on the one road leading out of town.Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away.Kalunga said the airport, although still under government control, was in effect unoperational because of the rebel surface-to-air-missiles deployed nearby.The rebels say they now control one-third of Kindu and are poised to overrun the rest of the town.
Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea exports in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into a war zone.``People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy,'' said Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner.Few people in northeastern Congo expected another rebellion so soon.
Russian space officials gave the first module of the international space station a routine tweak Saturday to push it into higher orbit, and convened a meeting on Earth to map out its future.The heads of the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, along with the European Space Agency, met in Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project, the Interfax news agency reported.Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, was quoted as saying that Russia would take the lead role 
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization.Russian space officials and others cheered as ground control announced that the capsule had separated from its booster rocket and reached its first orbit at about 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth.The heads of the space agencies of 16 nations participating in the project watched the lift-off from a distance of about 5 kilometers (3 miles).
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday.``We have mutually concluded that it would not be prudent to make these changes,'' Brinkley said during a news conference held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.The Russians have so little money that the United States and other partners in the international station fear that money spent on Mir will prevent Russia from meeting its obligations with the new project.
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.``We have capture of Zarya,'' commander Robert Cabana announced the moment the two pieces came together.It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
The first part of the international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization.A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the module into its initial orbit 200 kilometers (125 miles) above the Earth and the unit was operating as planned, officials said.Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting 
1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to Unity, the American-made side of the space station.Their other job, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna on Zarya, the Russian-built control module.Once activated, the antennas will provide a direct, virtually uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission Control.
Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station.The unmanned launch, set for 9:40 Moscow time (0640 GMT) Friday from Baikonur in Kazakhstan, has been delayed for one year mainly because of the cash-strapped Russian space agency's failure to complete another part of the station.Having lost hope of getting the promised government funds, the Russian space agency has sold its early research time 
The launching was witnessed by the heads of the space agencies of the 16 nations that are sponsoring the station, which will cost at least $40 billion to build over the next five years.Zarya, built in Russia with $240 million from the United States, is to be joined in two weeks by the first American module, a docking hub called Unity.However, in recent weeks Russian officials have been lobbying to find ways to extend Mir's life.
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle.In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.In all, three spacewalks were planned for Endeavour's 12-day flight.
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.Mission Control thought Sunday's work might take hours longer than planned and gave the six astronauts plenty of time for the tasks.It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
