He urged the president to follow his example and quit, too.But Democrats said they were aghast, and many _ including Clinton _ called on Livingston to reconsider his decision.DeLay, No.
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.``My fate is in your hands,'' Livingston told the Republicans, according to lawmakers who were present.``During my 33-year marriage to my wife, Bonnie, I have on occasion strayed from my marriage, and doing so nearly cost me my marriage and family,'' Livingston said in his brief prepared statement
