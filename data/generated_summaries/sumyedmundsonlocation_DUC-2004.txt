The only thing certain now is uncertainty.The smart money shouts that President Clinton will never resign, and he concurs.Nobody said that after eight years under Ronald Reagan, and that was only 15 years later.
Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months.He urged the president to follow his example and quit, too.``We need to stop destroying imperfect people at an unattainable altar of public morality,'' he said, urging his colleagues to ``step back from the abyss'' and reject resignation, impeachment and ``vicious self-righteousness
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a statement after appearing 
In the end, the will of the people meant nothing.Bob Livingston couldn't have been clearer about that.Let us disregard the people.
Rejecting a last-minute Democratic attempt to soften its action to censure, the House of Representatives moved to impeach President William Jefferson Clinton for perjury on Saturday and to call on the Senate to try him, convict him and remove him from office.But even before the vote, Republicans pressed another line of attack, demanding Clinton's resignation.``The majority has simply tried to dress up the perjury counts in the Watergate abuse-of-power language,'' Conyers said.

It has gotten to the point where drastic action may be necessary.You know those movies about Ebola virus outbreaks, where the guys in sterile suits come in, seal off the area and completely irradiate it?And I hate it.
``We are here to debate impeachment and should not be distracted from that,'' the minority whip, Rep. David Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, said during Saturday's House debate, in what leaped out as an impossible goal.It would have taken a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture the constantly shifting images competing for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House.But as all the jabbering and political posturing continued, as reporters raced to cover the president's statement
