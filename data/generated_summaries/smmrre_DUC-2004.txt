The smart money argues that the Senate could not muster the 67 votes that would be needed to remove the wounded president from office, which would require the defection of 12 Democrats if all the Republicans stand against him. Even before Saturday's epochal roll-calls, four of ten Americans interviewed in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll said they thought the president should step down if he were to be indicted, despite the fact that a large majority voiced disapproval of the impeachment proceedings. Almost all of the Republicans who 
Rep. Bob Livingston, who confessed to his colleagues Thursday night that he had had adulterous affairs, stunned the House chamber Saturday morning by saying in the impeachment debate on President Clinton that he would not serve as speaker and would quit Congress in six months. But at the White House, where calls for Clinton's resignation are derided as a Republican strategy, the president sent a spokesman into the driveway to urge Livingston to reconsider his resignation. ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,'' Livingston announced 
House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past. ``It has suddenly come to my attention that there are individuals working together with the media who are investigating my personal background in an effort to find indiscretions which may be exploitable against me and my party on the eve of the upcoming historic vote on impeachment,'' Livingston declared in a 
Even as the bombing continued in Iraq and Americans from coast to coast were clamoring for an alternative to impeachment, even as his own adulterous past was being flushed out in the grotesque invasions of privacy that inevitably followed the relentlessly prurient pursuit of the president, even as the country began to contemplate the destructive effects of a lengthy and bitter Senate trial, the speaker-designate arrogantly and stupidly proclaimed: ``Let us disregard the outside influences.'' Rep. Thomas Barrett, a Democrat from Wisconsin, tried to remind his Republican colleagues that 
One who did not, Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said Saturday: ``After Judge Starr's report to Congress in September, and his presentation to the Judiciary Committee in November, I concluded that impeachable offenses were not proven, and that the proven offenses were not impeachable. ``But the president's continued failure to come to grips with his actions, the sincerity and arguments of members of the Judiciary Committee from both sides of the aisle, the change of heart and conviction by members on my side of the aisle who 
at Speaker-elect Robert Livingston when he called from the House floor for President Clinton to quit the White House in the face of certain impeachment. ``I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow,'' Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond. declared Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., a leading presidential defender trying to rally Democrats around the argument that Livingston should not resign any more than President Clinton should quit under fire.
The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 20: The Republicans' drive for a partisan impeachment based soley on party-line voting power rather than any sense of proportion produced an unexpected sideshow in the resignation of Rep. Bob Livingston from his role as future speaker of the House. It must resist those Republicans who want to short-circuit the constitutional process with demands for resignation, and it must use the upcoming Senate trial as a forum for finding a censure commensurate with the president's personal dishonesty and offenses 
Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton. His disclosure followed an investigation by Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, the sex magazine, who said Friday at a news conference in Beverly Hills, Calif., that his publication had learned that Livingston had had adulterous affairs during the last 10 years. ``We're not going to say, `Bob, you can't be speaker because you violated your vows with your wife,''' 
The Ship of Fools reached cruising speed on Friday evening, when we had the frightening scene of Republicans so crazed with hatred of the president that they were railroading through an impeachment even though the United States was at war with Iraq, even though the House chamber was mostly empty, even though Republicans were huddled in a glass house on the issue of sex and lies, and even though the White House was still pitching a tent and planning sleigh rides for a Winter Wonderland press party on Monday. It might be a great time 
It would have taken a kaleidoscopic television screen to capture the constantly shifting images competing for center stage: impeachment, Iraq, the resignation of Rep. Robert Livingston, the response from the White House. All the networks and cable channels carried the moment that unexpectedly set the tone, as Livingston, a Louisiana Republican, announced during the debate that he would not become House speaker. The Republicans used Livingston's resignation to say that the president should resign, too; the Democrats immediately countered with the idea that the president would stay and 
China's national soccer team could call back four players from overseas to boost its chances at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, an official newspaper reported Monday. Englishman Bob Houghton, who coaches the national team, said recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to ``see if they can bring the things they have learned recently in England to the national team,'' the China Sports Daily said. Houghton also said that Yang, who plays in Frankfurt, ``very possibly could become an extremely important player 
Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week, a Saudi official said Saturday. Saudi Arabia's top sports official, Prince Faisal bin Fahd, is studying a proposal by the Olympic Council of Asia to at least send a symbolic delegation to the Dec. 6-20 Games, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But observers point rather to Saudi anger at the failure of Thai authorities to solve two, decade-old criminal cases involving their nationals
A snooker game between longtime Asian rivals India and Pakistan led to a flareup of tempers Sunday, showing a depth of differences that shocked Thai organizers and spectators at the Asian Games. A Thai referee's decision that India's Yashin Merchant had committed a foul during a decisive frame sparked a fierce debate with the referee that forced stoppage of play for 15 minutes. The match was one of the first as snooker made its Asian Games debut in style, with elated officials greeting the opening with muffled clapping, in keeping with the sport
In rites building from low flares symbolizing dawn to a fiery cauldron lighting, Thailand's king opened the Asian Games Sunday night, giving Thais some respite from an economic crisis that once threatened the continent's Olympic-style event. ``It's not just getting a gold, it's getting a gold with a result that is close or at world standards,'' said Li Furong, deputy head of China's Asian Games delegation. The combined budget for the opening and closing ceremonies was 70 million baht (dlrs 1.94 million)
Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games' veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday. ``If the Iranian team can borrow a couple of more horses from other participating countries, they still can compete,'' she said. Many of the horses are suffering stress from the journey here, but those from Asian countries are adjusting faster than those from cold countries, Siraya said.
Saudi Arabia's abrupt withdrawal from the Asian Games left organizers scrambling Thursday to change schedules and Thai diplomats mulling a decade of relations strained by jewel theft and the murder of diplomats. Bhichai Rattakul, deputy prime minister and president of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, asked the Foreign Ministry to urge the Saudi government to reconsider withdrawing its 105-strong team. In a letter to the Thai prime minister's office, reported Thursday by Bangkok newspapers, Saudi sports authorities cited the looming Muslim holy month of Ramadan and national centenary celebrations as reasons 
Thailand won host rights for the quadrennial games in 1995, but setbacks in preparations led officials of the Olympic Council of Asia late last year to threaten to move the games to another country. ``We have a strong of sense of relief,'' said Abdul Muttaleb al-Ahmad, director general of the Kuwait-based Olympic Council of Asia and a frequent critic of Thailand's organizing committee. The Olympic Council of Asia, meanwhile, is working with the Bangkok Organizing Committee to come up with a contingency plan in case of 
Organizers of December's Asian Games have dismissed press reports that a sports complex would not be completed on time, saying preparations are well in hand, a local newspaper said Friday. Santiparb Tejavanija, deputy secretary of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee, said construction of the sports complex at the Muang Thong Thani housing estate is 95 percent complete and will be finished this month, the Bangkok Post reported. Liquidity problems at Bangkok Land, the company that owns the housing estate, threatened to prevent the company from finishing the complex in 
Thai police have detained more than 300 beggars, most from neighboring countries, in a campaign to make Bangkok's streets safer for spectators and athletes arriving for the upcoming Asian Games, a senior police officer said Friday. About 100 of those detained were displayed Friday to local and foreign press at a detention center in Bangkok. Other groups targeted by police in advance of the Asian Games are foreign criminal gangs believed to operate in Bangkok and other major cities in Thailand.
The Pakistanis say all their athletes and officials for the games opening Sunday have been told not to even think of the wonder drug and ``night life ideas.'' Indian officials in charge of various sports meet their athletes at 10 p.m. before bedtime at the Asian Games village. For the Sri Lankans, ``we have told them that they will not be allowed outside the games village until they finish their discipline,'' said Upali Bandaratillaka, a serving brigadier in the Sri Lankan army.
The officials said the raid was timed so that more than 70 cruise missiles would hit bin Laden's camps at the moment when the Central Intelligence Agency believed he would be meeting there with his chief operatives. ``As we said from the time of the Aug. 20 strike, the objective was to disrupt the training, organization and infrastructure of the bin Laden terrorist network at the Khost camps,'' said David C. Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House. That review, officials said, provided the 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, 
The writer, who federal authorities believe was Haroun Fazil, who was to become one of the central suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi a year later, noted with alarm British press reports about the arrest of an aide to bin Laden. Along the way, in an almost casual fashion, the document seems to confirm two of the central charges of the federal case against bin Laden: That he had planted a terrorist cell in Nairobi and that his operatives carried out another of the crimes laid at bin Laden
If Osama bin Laden ever stands trial in New York for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa and other acts of terror, it is already clear who prosecutors will call as a chief witness: One of his senior aides who has been talking to U.S. investigators for two years. According to the government, the informant worked closely with bin Laden from 1989 to 1996, a period when prosecutors assert that bin Laden was ordering deadly attacks on U.S. soldiers in Somalia and elsewhere. But at least one operative of bin Laden's 
``America is looking for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' Saqib said. Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United States has become insecure. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.
Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French national and self-confessed member of Bin Laden's Albanian network, the newspaper said. Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 after telling the 
Police arrested two journalists and charged them with writing articles to encourage Muslim youths to stage an Islamic revolution in Bangladesh after the Taliban model in Afghanistan, a police officer said Thursday. They were arrested under a 1974 law that allows police to detain any one for offenses related to national security, the officer said on condition of anonymity. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government hasn't recognized the Taliban government in Afghanistan.
MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ U.S. prosecutors have asked for a 20-day extension to provide Germany with paperwork necessary to extradite a top lieutenant of Saudi terrorist suspect Osama bin Laden, officials said Saturday. Under German law, U.S. officials have 40 days after the arrest to turn over supporting evidence so a German court can rule on their extradition request. A Bavarian Justice Ministry spokesman, Gerhard Zierl, said U.S. authorities a few days ago asked the court hearing the case for an extra 20 days to provide the necessary material.
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin. The Taliban have told bin Laden, however, that political activity is banned and he has agreed to respect that, the Taliban information minister said in a statement Friday.
The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials. Senior administration officials say that at the time of the cruise missile strike they had evidence of Sudan's involvement with bin Laden in a chemical weapons program, but no direct evidence linking the Shifa plant directly to that effort. Officials say U.S. intelligence 
Even so, most oil industry analysts contend that improved efficiency from combining giant energy companies would do more to lower costs than the more concentrated ownership of gas stations and refineries would do to raise them. Though Mobil and Exxon might have high concentrations of gas stations in certain areas of the United States, analysts say they have far more competition at the pump than before oil prices collapsed in the 1980s. Back when Standard Oil organized its operations by state, Exxon was Standard Oil of New Jersey, while Mobil was Standard Oil of 
So when the 900 or so remaining blue-collar workers here at Mobil's largest domestic refinery, out of about 1,500 a decade ago, heard last week that their company was discussing a possible merger with Exxon, it was like a siren warning them that an already suspect valve might be about to blow. The latest evidence of where things were heading hulked right nearby, he said, glancing over at a new power plant likely to be operated by an outside company without the unions that now man the refinery's generators. 
Still, it boggles the mind to accept the notion that hardship is driving profitable Big Oil to either merge, as British Petroleum and Amoco have already agreed to do, or at least to consider the prospect, as Exxon and Mobil are doing. In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. You know, every time I see forecasts that 
Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. Exxon, which has a market value of $176.7 billion, and Mobil, which has a market value of $61.1 billion, both have histories of being fiercely independent, and both have already cut back on staff and made themselves lean to survive even during a prolonged period of low oil prices. He added, however, that any combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an 
Exxon was then known as Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Mobil consisted of two companies: Standard Oil of New York and Vacuum Oil. He added, however, that a combination between Exxon and Mobil would not be an easy match because Mobil has been known for being a proud company that has said in the past that it would not want to merge. But Amy Jaffe, an energy research analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, said the combination of the two companies would be logical, in 
Exxon and Mobil, the nation's two largest oil companies, confirmed Friday that they were discussing a possible merger, and antitrust lawyers, industry analysts and government officials predicted that any deal would require the sale of important large pieces of such a new corporate behemoth. But in retailing and marketing operations, an Exxon-Mobil combination would be ``like Ford merging with General Motors, Macy's with Gimbels,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust lawyer in New York who represented Texaco in its acquisition of Getty more than a decade 
It was new highs again for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock and Nasdaq composite indexes Friday as anticipation of a new wave of mergers and a general rush by investors to join the equity rebound pushed stocks up. Mobil, along with Exxon, Chevron, IBM and Microsoft, which rose 3 13/16, to 128 1/16, were the power behind the S &AMP; P. It climbed 5.46 points, or five-tenths of a percent, to 1,192.33, a new high, the second of the week. Many 
Rather, it is among smaller companies, whose still-depressed stock prices are luring bigger acquirers with stocks that again are near their peaks. If Exxon buys Mobil at close to current prices, deals this month will have a total value of more than $140 billion _ off from April's peak of $244 billion but three times the volume in September, when the stock market was falling. Another pick is Smart and Final, an operator of warehouse-style stores that is 55 percent owned by the U.S. subsidiary of 
Still, Big Oil and small oil are getting squeezed by low petroleum prices and the high capital costs of exploration. In the first decade of the next century, the really big exploration opportunities will be very capital intensive, and only companies with the deepest pockets will be able to stay in the game: Royal Dutch, Exxon and BP Amoco. (end italics) A. I think oil companies are still a worthwhile investment, but it is not a place where an investor should plan on making money over the next 9 to 
The boards of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. are expected to meet Tuesday to consider a possible merger agreement that would form the world's largest oil company, a source close to the negotiations said Friday. Sieminski and other analysts said Exxon would have to offer a premium of about 15 to 20 percent over its price prior to Monday, when serious speculation of an Exxon takeover of Mobil first circulated and sent Mobil shares up sharply. The merger discussions come against a backdrop of particularly severe pressure on Lucio Noto, the chairman, president 
British sailor Glyn Charles was missing and presumed drowned _ becoming the third fatality in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race _ while three others remained missing in rough seas after nightfall Monday. Two more crew from the Winston Churchill were plucked from a second liferaft late Monday night, but three others who had been aboard the liferaft were still missing. ``The worst thing of the whole affair was that after we got into the life raft and became separated from the others, the damned thing capsized twice on these great seas at 
Two yacht crew members are dead, three yachts remain missing and rescue resources were stretched to the limit Monday as huge seas and gale-force winds continued to batter the Sydney-to-Hobart race fleet. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 30-foot Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had rolled in heavy seas near Gabo Island about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Melbourne. A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island
United States maxi Sayonara looks set to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday. New Zealand Endeavour trumped the locals in 1992, Sayonara won in 1995 and German's Morning Glory set a race record of two days, 14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds the following year. Sayonara's rivals are expected to be last year's line honors winner Brindabella of Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing.

Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday. ``There are two that have been confirmed deceased which is tragedy because in the 54-year history of the race I think there's only two people who have died in it before,'' said Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman David Gray. Guy suffered a heart attack during one of the two occasions the yacht rolled, Gray said, while Skeggs drowned when he was unable to free 
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing. With winds gusting to 90 mph (145 kph) and seas swelling to 35 feet (10 meters), the race continued even as rescue teams searched for the missing vessels. ``It does say in the instructions that it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires,'' he said.
Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving two yachts missing. The two dead were found on the 40-foot vessel Business Post Naiad, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) off the New South Wales state town of Merimbula, according to the Australian Search and Rescue Coordination Center (AusSAR) in Canberra.

Leading maxi yachts Brindabella, Sayonara and Marchioness were locked in a three-way duel down the New South Wales state coast Saturday as the Sydney to Hobart fleet faced deteriorating weather. All three maxis reported in at the same latitude during Saturday night's positioning report when they were about 30 nautical miles south of Jervis Bay on the New South Wales south coast. American maxi Sayonara and Sydney boat Brindabella reported they were about 50 kilometers (30 miles) offshore while Marchioness was a couple of miles further inshore.

The Australian Navy has sent a Sea King helicopter with night-vision and heat-seeking equipment to search the area and may send the frigate HMAS Newcastle into the area Monday morning morning from Sydney. An AMSA spokesman said they were alerted that the 13-meter Sydney yacht Sword of Orion had been rolled in the heavy seas, with several crewmen being injured, including the unidentified man lost overboard.

Three years later, in a contract arbitration involving the Knicks' Patrick Ewing, the agent David Falk would contend that the NBA conspired with the Celtics to circumvent the salary cap, in order to satisfy Bird. ``I can understand both sides,'' said Bird, safely in the middle, between Bird, the former exception, and Bird, the present Indiana Pacers' coach. ``If Larry and Magic hadn't done what they did, we might not survive what we're about to go through,'' said Bill 
Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games. Not only are both sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout _ but the owners and players also are making time to win public opinion before they test their 
In a critical ruling for the North American National Basketball Association and the players' union, arbitrator John Feerick decides Monday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout. In a six-day hearing over the summer, the union argued that owners should have protected themselves from being liable for guaranteed salaries during a work stoppage by inserting lockout language into the standard player contract. He said it was his understanding when he negotiated the old labor agreement in 1995 that players would not be paid if the owners 
Despite modest encouragement over a new proposal delivered by the players to the owners, the National Basketball Association Tuesday canceled the first two weeks of the regular season, the first time in the league's 51-year history that it will lose games to a labor dispute.

More than 220 National Basketball Association players with guaranteed contracts will find out Monday whether they are to be paid during the management lockout, a long-awaited arbitrator's decision that may affect leverage in the league's dispute with the players and have major ramifications on American sports-labor law. But neither the players nor the owners are counting on the ruling by the arbitrator, John Feerick, to speed up negotiations, especially if Feerick finds in favor of the players, an award that could approach $800 million in salaries. 
``We want to show the public that we, as players, want to play,'' said Ewing, who was flanked by five teammates. Owners would like to implement a restrictive salary cap that would eventually put a ceiling on how much one player can earn. ``All we want is our fair share and we feel like they're trying to take that away from us,'' Ewing said.
Still, a five-hour meeting that was described as cordial by the league and ``almost like two bulls letting off a little steam'' by the players association produced another scheduled round of talks next Tuesday. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, said the league would wait until after next week's meeting before deciding to cancel regular-season games.

The number of players making $1 million to $2 million a year _ the middle class, in NBA terms _ fell sharply. In the current negotiation, the league has offered to guarantee that its payroll will rise 20 percent over the next four years, from $1 billion to $1.2 billion, and says it is open to proposals to split that money any way the players want, whether by raising the minimum salary or guaranteeing raises for veterans.

The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 26: Since the deadly bombing of two American embassies in Africa in August, there has been a troubling accumulation of evidence that the State Department inexplicably ignored warnings of possible terrorist attacks against the installations. The latest and most disturbing account suggests that nine months before the truck bombing in Kenya, the department received a detailed description of the planned attack but did little to strengthen security at the embassy. Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed's account was so specific _ he said terrorists 
Federal prison officials have cut off virtually all communications for two men being held in Manhattan in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. A federal prison official said Monday that the government moved under a rarely used federal rule that allows prison officials to limit an inmate's contacts to prevent future ``acts of violence and terrorism.'' A Bureau of Prisons official in Washington confirmed that the two men are joining a group of about six inmates throughout the country being held under the restrictions.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said Thursday. Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York. Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, 
The new indictment, which supersedes the June action, accused bin Laden of leading a vast terrorist conspiracy from 1989 to the present, in which he was said to be working in concert with governments, including those of Sudan, Iraq and Iran, and terrorist groups, to build weapons and attack American military installations. Both indictments offer new information about bin Laden's operations, including one deal he is said to have struck with Iraq to cooperate in the development of weapons in return for bin Laden's agreeing not to work against 
``America is looking for an excuse to fire more rockets on our dear Afghanistan and that excuse is bin Laden,'' Saqib said. Saqib, who heads a judicial inquiry established by the Taliban to investigate the terrorism charges against bin Laden, says the United States has become insecure. The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.
German police raided several locations near Bonn after receiving word of a terrorist threat against the U.S. Embassy, but no evidence of a planned attack was found, officials said Wednesday. Security was tightened at U.S. installations worldwide after the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. authorities charge Salim helped finance, train and arm members of a terrorist organization, including the alleged bombers of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
Police and soldiers on Friday blocked off the street in front of a house where members of a terrorist gang are believed to have assembled the bomb that blew up the U.S. Embassy, killing 11 people. Two men, Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, have been formally charged by a Tanzanian magistrate in the Aug. 7 embassy bombing. Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, one of the three men in custody in the United States for the Nairobi bombing, told police in Pakistan where he was arrested after arriving from Nairobi Aug. 
Bin Laden, believed to be in Afghanistan, and a top aide were indicted Wednesday by a U.S. District Court in the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa and are accused of conspiring to kill Americans outside the United States. ``It is a challenge to the entire Muslim world ... Bin Laden is a hero of the Muslim world,'' said Omar Warsi, a leader of Pakistan's militant Sunni Muslim group, Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the Friends of the Prophet. Harakat is considered a strong supporter of bin 
A federal district judge agreed Tuesday to review complaints by lawyers for three men arrested after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that their jail conditions in Manhattan are unconstitutional and inhumane. Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan said he had received an eight-page letter from lawyers for two of three defendants in custody in Manhattan. In discussing conditions at the Manhattan jail, the lawyers said that two of the defendants have not been able to call their families, while the third has been allowed to make only one 
The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya was declared a free man Friday in Afghanistan, where he has lived for years with the permission of the hard-line Islamic Taliban militia. ``Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin.

Though North Korea is suffering from a simple lack of food, a faltering economy in Cambodia combined with weak health care and education is causing similar levels of malnutrition in children, said Ken Davies, the WFP's country director. According to a recent WFP survey, 49 percent of Cambodian children under age 5 are stunted by lack of food and 20 percent suffer from acute malnutrition. Poor sanitation, lack of health care and ignorance of modern child rearing _ problems left mostly unaddressed by under-funded health and education sectors in Cambodia 
Police in northeastern China's Jilin province said Monday they had rounded up at least 100 North Koreans and sent them back to endure a famine in their reclusive country. A police official in the Jilin city of Tonghua, near the North Korean border, said the North Koreans were forced to repatriate because some had resettled illegally in China, had formed criminal gangs or engaged in prostitution.

North Korea claimed 71 of those cattle died because Seoul government agents force-fed them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps of rope before shipping them to the North. On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Kang In-duk said North Korea sent a letter to Hyundai last week, saying that ``the misunderstanding with the southern authorities on the issue of the dead cattle is cleared
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages with its people malnourished and at risk of dying from normally curable illnesses, senior Red Cross officials said Tuesday. ``Humanitarian suffering cannot be routine in any part of the world,'' said Margareta Wahlstrom, the Red Cross' undersecretary of disaster relief, who returned to Beijing Tuesday after a week inspecting the aid agency's operations in North Korea. She and other Red Cross officials saw further ravages of North Korea's slow-motion famine: electricity supplied to only 
Kim Myong Sup, 23, had been living in hiding in a ``third country'' since fleeing North Korea last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. The ministry generally uses the term ``third country'' to avoid naming China, which is required by treaty with North Korea to return defectors to their homeland. About 200 North Koreans have defected to South Korea in the past three years, including 60 so far this year.
North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of grain to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the World Food Program said. But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi said the government about a month ago cut the number of counties to which the WFP has access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people who can get aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million. Ngongi, who spent four days inspecting WFP relief 
More than five years of severe food shortages and a near-total breakdown in the public health system have led to devastating malnutrition in North Korea and probably left an entire generation of children physically and mentally impaired, a new study by international aid groups has found. And while the researchers and aid workers on the ground in North Korea have not seen evidence of cannibalism or starving children dying by the roadside _ descriptions that have surfaced in the more lurid refugee reports _ what they did find was in many ways equally disturbing: A 
Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North Korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday. A survey carried out in September and October also showed that 16 percent of children in North Korea are acutely malnourished, with a body weight too low for their height. Children in North Korea's three largest cities _ Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampo _ were better off than their counterparts elsewhere, with 11 percent acutely malnourished.
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years. North Korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean 
Despite catastrophic hunger at home, North Korea plans to send 317 athletes and officials to next month's Asian Games in Thailand, South Korean officials said Thursday. North Korean Sports Minister Chang Ung said 209 athletes from his country will compete in 21 events in Bangkok, hoping to win medals in women's judo, women's soccer, wrestling, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing. Chang said North Korea was sending a large delegation to Bangkok to prepare for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned, officials said. Yeltsin was to fly back to Moscow late Monday, rather than on Tuesday as scheduled, but was going ahead with talks, including a meeting with Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He planned to move up all his scheduled meetings before returning home, aides said.
President Boris Yeltsin, on his first trip out of Russia since this spring, canceled a welcoming ceremony in Uzbekistan on Sunday because he wasn't feeling well, his spokesman said. During his visits to Uzbekistan and Kazakstan this week, Yeltsin is expected to discuss improving Russia's relations with the two former Soviet republics, whose economies have suffered residual effects of the crisis that hit Russia after it devalued its currency in August and defaulted on some of its debt. Later Monday, Yeltsin is to go to Kazakstan, where he and 
President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday, nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern. Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov, confirmed that the president was suffering from a respiratory infection known as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is stable.'' ``Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions is damaging Russian state authority, as power is being misused by the clique close to the president,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of parliament's security 
Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term. Yeltsin has flatly said he will not seek another term, and the opposition has concentrated its efforts on demanding an early resignation, riding a wave of popular discontent over the economic crisis. Mikhail Mityukov, the presidential representative on the Constitutional Court, said Thursday that Yeltsin would ignore calls for an early resignation.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday. Government sources said the president has also called off a visit to Austria later this month, but the Kremlin said those plans were still going forward. Yeltsin is still planning to go to Vienna for an Oct. 27-28 summit of European nations, the president's office said.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. Yeltsin's premature return to Moscow also prompted doubts about his capacity to respond decisively in the Kosovo crisis, in which Russia has been leading a campaign to forestall airstrikes. There was no indication that Yeltsin's illness would sideline him for any length of time, and aides said the president would maintain his schedule for the rest of the week
President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday. Asked about small bandages that were visible on Yeltsin's hand during an awards ceremony, the press office said the president had sustained small burns. It did not say what had caused them.
President Boris Yeltsin's doctors have pronounced his health ``more or less normal,'' his wife Naina said in an interview published Wednesday. ``The doctors say now: Everything is more or less normal,'' Mrs. Yeltsin declared. Mrs. Yeltsin refuted rumors that her family would leave Russia after Yeltsin leaves office in 2000 as ``absolute nonsense.''

The government is already in charge, (Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov is strong enough and has the support of the security services,'' said Yevgeny Volk, director of the Moscow office of the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation. In the Kremlin, Yeltsin discussed developments in Kosovo with Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russian news agencies said. Primakov said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively ``when we reminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness'' and said of his doctors: 
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games. IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund _ described as ``humanitarian aid'' by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a ``bribe.'' The controversy is now bound to overshadow the routine progress report which the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) is scheduled to make to the IOC executive board this weekend
Saying ``if we have to clean, we will clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch responded on Sunday to allegations of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declaring that IOC members who were found to have accepted bribes from candidate cities could be expelled. Hodler, the second most senior member of the IOC, said Saturday that he knew of four agents, including one IOC member, who engaged in such activities. The issue of vote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of the recent disclosure of scholarship payments made to 
Following is the text of the rules on gifts and benefits that were in force during the bidding for the 2002 Winter Olympics: _ ``The finalist cities as well as third parties acting for them or on their behalf or in their favor, are forbidden to give IOC members _ as well as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or companions _ any presents, liberalities or direct or indirect benefits other than souvenirs ot small presents of a total value which shall in no case exceed U.S. dlrs 150 per person.'' 
Samaranch said he was surprised at the allegations of corruption in the International Olympic Committee made by senior Swiss member Marc Hodler. But he said the allegations would be considered by a special IOC panel looking into alleged rules violations by the Salt Lake group which won the 2002 Winter Games. Samaranch said Hodler should have brought his allegations first to the IOC executive board.
A top IOC official on Saturday made explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities. Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games.
Moving quickly to tackle an escalating corruption scandal, IOC leaders questioned Salt Lake City officials Friday in the first ever investigation into alleged vote-buying by an Olympic city. Pound said the panel would investigate allegations that ``there may or may not have been payments for the benefit of members of the IOC or their families connected with the Salt Lake City bid.'' Salt Lake organizers have denied that the bid committee's dlrs 500,000 project was an effort to buy key IOC members' support in the four years between votes on the 
The mayor of the Japanese city of Nagano, site of the 1998 Winter Olympics, denied allegations that city officials bribed members of the International Olympic Committee to win the right to host the games. Japan Olympic Committee has warned cities seeking to host the games in the future that they should not entertain IOC members excessively, the newspaper said. Nagano became the first Asian city to host the Winter Games since Sapporo, Japan played host to the 1972 games.

Swiss IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said Sunday he might be thrown out of the International Olympic Committee for making allegations of corruption within the Olympic movement. Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since been ``muzzled'' by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The IOC, meanwhile, said it was prepared to investigate allegations made by Hodler of bribery in the selection of Olympic host cities.
The senior Olympic official who leveled stunning allegations of corruption within the IOC said Sunday he had been ``muzzled'' by president Juan Antonio Samaranch and might be throw out of the organization. Marc Hodler, the Swiss member of the IOC executive board, said Samaranch had ordered him to keep quiet. Asked whether he might resign, Hodler said, ``No, I don't resign.
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to 
Following a series of intricate maneuvers and the skillful use of the space shuttle Endeavour's robot arm, astronauts on Sunday joined the first two of many segments that will form the international space station. The two station pieces, together measuring about 77 feet from end to end and having a combined mass of 70,000 pounds, are the first of 100 major components to be united in space over the next five years to form an orbiting outpost that would weigh almost a million pounds and span an area the size of two football fields. 
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
The docking ring between them would not retract properly; Mission Control quickly traced the problem to the attached robot arm and asked the crew to release its hold on the docked Zarya.

The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion. On their 12-day flight, Endeavour's astronauts are to locate a Russian part already in orbit, grasp it with the shuttle's robot arm and attach the new U.S. module. As Col. Currie holds Zarya steady, Endeavour's commander, Col. Robert Cabana of the Marine Corps, a veteran of three space 
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight. But NASA was confident the master alarm in Endeavour's cockpit would behave; it went off with just 4{ minutes to go in the countdown Thursday, forcing a delay. NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians.
A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station. This was the first time in three years, and 19 flights, that a shuttle countdown had been stopped after the spaceship was fueled and the crew aboard the craft and ready to go. ``We want to err on the conservative side,'' Ralph Roe, launch director at the Kennedy Space Center, said at a news conference after the sudden halt of the countdown just 
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.

On education, the issue that President Clinton has propelled to the forefront of the talks and on which Republicans do not want to appear recalcitrant, both sides have agreed to spend more than $1 billion but disagree over how to spend it. The two sides remained apart on several ideological matters, including whether to allow federal health plans to cover contraceptives and whether to allow those few plans with religious affiliations to refuse to cover contraceptives not only on religious grounds but on moral grounds as well. As they worked through several issues, 
House and Senate negotiators agreed Thursday to require most federal health plans to cover prescription contraceptives for women, giving an unusual victory on Capitol Hill to advocates of abortion rights. The contraceptive measure would require the federal health plans, which affect 1.2 million female federal employees who are of child-bearing age, to cover the five methods of contraception that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this country _ birth control pills, diaphragms, inter-uterine devices, Norplant and Depo-Provera.

A sticking point for White House and congressional budget negotiators has been the issue of how the 2000 census will be conducted, and the White House is finding itself negotiating on the issue as much with House Democrats as it is with the House Republican leaders. On Monday, White House negotiators, led by chief of staff Erskine Bowles, tried to determine whether Democrats would accept a deal to finance for six months the departments of State, Justice and Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau. But House Democrats balked at the idea of 
For the first time in decades, Congress and the White House negotiated tax and spending legislation this year with the budget in surplus. As hard as it was to negotiate a budget in the bad old days of budget deficits, say the politicians involved, it was exponentially more difficult this year. But much of the money, like the $90 million that will pay for six new helicopters for the national police in Colombia to use in drug interdiction, was designated emergency spending simply because there was no other way to get it 
Voting mainly on party lines on a question that has become a touchstone in the debate over development and preservation of wilderness, the Senate on Thursday approved a gravel road through remote wildlife habitat in Alaska. The road, barely 30 miles long, would slice across the edge of a wildlife refuge and wilderness area on the Aleutian Peninsula, where it would connect an isolated village called King Cove to a long-range air strip in the town of Cold Bay. ``Building a road through a wilderness in Alaska, no matter how 
Top-level budget negotiators for congressional Republicans and the White House concluded yet another bargaining session late Sunday afternoon with plans to resume talks on Monday morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline for another day or two. Congress has passed only six of the 13 required spending bills and are negotiating now with the White House on a final omnibus package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how much money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under what conditions it 
Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers. They cited two reasons: Clinton needed to curry favor with Democrats to shore up support if the House votes to impeach him, and Republican leaders feared that if they had stood up to Clinton, they might have forced a government shutdown and Republicans would be blamed. Gingrich said the agreement was the best that could be achieved ``

Some conservatives sounded notes of discord Friday over the federal spending agreement, but they also said they would probably vote for the $500 billion package because it boosted defense spending and provided aid to farmers. That is now being crafted by the chairmen of the spending committees and their aides, who said Friday that there were still disputes that needed to be resolved and that the final document could run to more than 3,000 pages. Almost everyone on Capitol Hill expects the budget to pass eventually, with the biggest defections coming from conservatives who 
Less than a week before U.S. President Bill Clinton is to arrive for a visit meant to bolster a new Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, the two sides exchanged angry accusations Sunday over Jewish settlements and street clashes. Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, warned of possible violence if Israel continues to expand settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinians hope to establish a state. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, ministers expressed dismay over an outbreak of street clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday accused Yasser Arafat of ``making a farce'' of the Wye River accords and said he would not agree to further troop withdrawals until a halt to anti-Israel violence. Netanyahu said he did not believe the United States was siding with the Palestinians, but his sharply worded remarks sent a strong signal that he would like President Bill Clinton to intervene and lower Palestinian expectations prior to his Dec. 12-15 trip. In the interview, Netanyahu stressed that he opposed Palestinian statehood and demanded that Arafat 
Israel affirmed Friday that it will not withdraw troops in the West Bank unless the top Palestinian decision-making body holds a vote to annul clauses of the PLO charter calling for Israel's destruction. Just a day before U.S. President Bill Clinton's arrival, Israel also rejected a U.S. compromise on the release of Palestinian prisoners, an issue that has sparked riots in the West Bank. A senior Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States has not asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to consider holding a vote.
Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace process forward, which has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered the Palestinians, may not be enough to save his government from collapse next week. Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord. Clinton had hoped, 3rd graf pvs
Clinton administration officials said the White House had not yet decided whether Clinton would fly to the newly opened Gaza International Airport aboard Air Force One, given the symbolism of the president's jet landing on Palestinian soil with the trappings of a state visit. Officials said the White House was fearful of upsetting Israeli leaders who are worried that the president's planned visit to Gaza appears to be a step toward American recognition of a Palestinian state. ``The prime minister wanted me to go there and wanted us all to make this pitch,
In an atmosphere of political tension, U.S. President Clinton met Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a bid to put the troubled Wye River peace accord back on track. ``President Clinton played a very important role in the Wye Memorandum and its success, and I think that it's going to be very, very important that this visit show us at least a readiness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to move forward in peace,'' Fogel said. Israel and the Palestinians are also in bitter disagreement over procedures for 
Armored personnel carriers were deployed Tuesday around the convention center where U.S. President Bill Clinton will address 1,500 Palestinian delegates next week. On Monday, Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are to address members of the Palestine National Council and delegates from other groups, at the Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. ``The Palestinian police are ready to protect President Clinton here in Gaza or in Bethlehem,'' Jabali said, referring to Clinton's expected visit next Tuesday to the Church of the Nativity in the biblical West Bank town of Bethlehem In 
Keeping a promise to Israel and the United States, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday convened senior officials and legislators to revoke clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction. Under the Wye agreement, the PNC is to reaffirm during this session an Arafat letter to Clinton which declares clauses of the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction revoked. On Thursday, 98 members of the 124-member Palestinian Central Council met at Arafat's seaside headquarters to hold a vote on whether to approve the Arafat letter concerning the PLO charter
Among those in attendance on this day, the first of the traditional three days of family mourning, was Saeb Erekat, the chief peace negotiator for Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. Three years ago, in another winter season, he came here to bury Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, gunned down by a nationalist Jew who could not abide the terms of a Mideast agreement that called _ just as this latest accord does _ for Israel to cede West Bank land in exchange for peace with the Palestinians. In the West Bank's worst 
David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas. Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas' military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic Jihad were outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but could not outlaw them outright as 
Israel's Cabinet decided Friday to suspend indefinitely its ratification of the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians. The Cabinet said it would not resume its debate or hold a vote on the accord until the Palestinian Authority has taken steps against terrorism. The Cabinet also said it would not resume the ratification process until Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has clarified the procedure for revoking clauses in the PLO founding charter calling for Israel's destruction.
On a warm, sunny morning last Friday, at the time he usually left for work at his family's produce store, Youssef Sughayer said goodbye to his grandmother for the last time and rode off to his death. Jailed for a year at age 15 for stoning Israeli cars during the riots of the Palestinian uprising, he was imprisoned again at 17, that time for three-and-a-half years for similar offenses and affiliation with Islamic Holy War. ``Up to the last minute on Thursday night we were 
Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the new peace accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expects Israel's Cabinet to ratify the new peace accord within a few days despite the market bombing, a television report said Saturday. Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not use Friday's suicide bombing, which killed the two assailants and wounded 21 Israelis, as an excuse 
The militant Palestinian movement Islamic Holy War said Saturday that it carried out the suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on Friday, which prompted arrests by the Palestinian Authority overnight. The two bombers who carried out Friday's attack, which led the Israeli Cabinet to suspend deliberations on the land-for-security accord signed with the Palestinians last month, were identified as members of Islamic Holy War from West Bank villages under Israeli security control. A Palestinian security official said several Islamic Holy War members were arrested in the West Bank on Friday 
A car rigged with explosives blew up Friday morning in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market packed with Israelis shopping for the Jewish Sabbath, killing two people and wounding 21. The Cabinet ministers had just begun a second day of of talks on the peace agreement about a mile (kilometer) away from the entrance to the market and just meters (yards) from the site of a suicide bombing last year. In Friday's explosion, the rigged car, a red Fiat, blew up at about 9:45 a.m. (0745 GMT) at 
Israel's Cabinet announced within hours of a market bombing Friday that it will put off a vote indefinitely on whether to ratify the Wye River accord until Palestinians crack down further on terrorism. Israel radio said the 18-member Cabinet debate on the Wye River accord would resume only after Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority fulfilled all of its commitments under the agreement, including arresting Islamic militants. The Cabinet also insisted that Arafat convene the Palestinian National Council, a parliament in exile, to abrogate the Palestinian National Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction
The radical group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility Saturday for the suicide bombing of a crowded Jerusalem market and promised more attacks to try to block the new peace accord. An Islamic Jihad official in the Syrian capital of Damascus confirmed that the group's leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing in an interview with the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo. There was no immediate explanation for the inaccurate claim, but the two groups have carried out attacks together in the past as part of their goal of stopping the peace process.
``We will build also in Har Homa as we will build in every part of Jerusalem,'' Netanyahu told a crowd of political supporters in Jerusalem, ``By 2000 there will be homes at Har Homa.'' Netanyahu's Cabinet delayed action on the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord following Friday's suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market, and his remarks about building on Har Homa may be seen as a provocation by the Palestinians at a politically sensitive moment. Palestinian political leaders said Israel should not use Friday's suicide bombing, which 
At police barricades set up along Jerusalem's busiest thoroughfare, soldiers and police held back crowds of people, some frantic about loved ones who had been shopping in the crowded market only hours before the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Although shop windows closest to the car were shattered, market stalls only a few more feet (yards) away were completely intact, and stacked with neat piles of bananas and onions. By the police barricades, wearing bright-orange vests, stood a group of Orthodox Jewish volunteers who search scenes of 
They will never succeed,'' former Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais said at the funeral for Starovoitova. Russian politicians and newspapers have speculated wildly about political motives for the killing, but police have said they have no idea why someone would have wanted her dead. Police said someone fired shots at the apartment of a member of the St. Petersburg legislature Monday night, Interfax said.
A badly wounded aide to a murdered lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police, who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city, officials said. Galina Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot dead by unidentified assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday night. Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say there was no evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was 
A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg, police said. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said. A finance official was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last month.
As outrage mounted Sunday, it seemed clear that the killing of Galina Starovoitova was not going to be treated as a routine crime, and some said it might turn out to be a watershed event in Russian politics. Although it was still not clear who killed Starovoitova or why, the killing had all the earmarkings of a contract hit _ a remarkably common crime in post-Soviet Russia. So deeply has the toxin infected Russian society that President Boris Yeltsin ordered an investigation last week into reports that his Federal Security Service _ the

In a bleak season of economic collapse and political timidity, the killing can only heighten fears that Russia is slipping into an ugly era of intolerance and political violence. She was a member of the Russian parliament and a recently declared candidate for governor of the region around St. Petersburg. She championed democracy and human rights long before they became politically acceptable in Moscow, and courageously stood by Boris Yeltsin and other reformers as Russia struggled to find a new political course when the Soviet Union disintegrated.
Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to mourn the shooting death of one of Russia's most prominent women, a potential presidential candidate whose killing was widely considered to be politically motivated. President Boris Yeltsin said he would personally assume control over the investigation into the killing of Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down Friday night as she climbed the stairs to her apartment. Yeltsin sent a telegram to Gennady Seleznyov, chairman of parliament's lower house, the State Duma, promising that the ``contractors and executors of the murder will be found and 
The police say the two were attacked in the stairwell of Mrs. Staravoitova's building by two assailants, one of them a young woman. Friends and relatives say Mrs. Staravoitova, a founder of Russia's democratic movement, had received death threats, but the motive for the killing remains unclear. At a gathering Sunday night in Moscow, Yegor Gaidar, a former Russian prime minister and a close ally of Mrs. Staravoitova, bitterly rejected suggestions that Russia should adopt extraordinary security measures to stem the rise in political crime.
Ms. Boyle, a former commissioner in Cuyahoga County, which encompasses Cleveland, is crisscrossing the nation's seventh-most populous state in what she describes as a grass-roots campaign that, while operating on a comparative shoestring, has nonetheless attracted to her side nationally known Democrats _ President Clinton foremost among them _ on the campaign trail. Like many candidates this year, Ms. Boyle, 55, is campaigning hard on the issue of education, seeking to portray Voinovich, 61, as a lackluster steward who allowed the state's 
In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters, President Clinton said Friday that he must ``live with the consequences'' of his mistakes, although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities. In Cleveland on Friday, he spoke for 26 minutes and here on Friday evening he spoke for almost 20 minutes. ``Mr. President, these are your friends here today,'' said Tony George, the host of the Cleveland event, offering the refrain of those who have played 
Well, Dr. Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet, and as an honorary committee chairman, she discovered, she would be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen. However far they are from Gingrich, the telemarketers are instructed to answer return calls with: ``Republican Congressional Committee, Newt Gingrich's office. To assure passage of the legislation, the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority, she says, adding, ``To help us do that, the speaker is 
Jennifer Duffy, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said that so far, at least, none of the Senate candidates has made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote on a presidential jury. In contests like those, it might well prove to be in the interest of a Democratic candidate to, as one consultant put it, sit down in front of a camera and tape an advertisement in which the candidate denounces the president's behavior but solemnly pledges to vote against 
Rivera, president of the largest union in New York City, praised D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to support legislation that financed health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children. Labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposals to curb labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board. Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the endorsement of 1199's parent union
White House officials and gay Democrats, concerned that the nation's largest gay and lesbian political organization is about to endorse Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for re-election, are intensely lobbying the group to try to shift its support to the Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer. If the group endorses D'Amato, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the endorsement would be based on three major factors: The group tends to favor incumbents, has been searching for allies among the Senate Republican majority and considers D'Amato's recent record on

But party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price and Mrs. Carson share something else: greater-than-expected peril on Election Day. In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans, the challengers in the Price and Carson districts _ both are political novices seeking office for the first time _ have differing strategies: Tom Roberg, a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price, has broadcast a television commercial 
Shimkus' measure is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as they stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement on spending bills with the White House, thus avoiding a government shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November elections. With time on their hands, many Republicans are using the House floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that they can boast about to the folks back home. House leaders allowed the measure to be brought to the floor as a way

In contrast to the old image of gung-ho FBI agents turning their surveillance machinery on political groups, a number of senior FBI agents privately expressed misgivings about the attorney general's latest task force, the second she has ordered to begin a broad investigation into a conspiracy involving anti-abortion violence. Senior agency officials, including Director Louis Freeh, were starting their careers in the early 1970s and watched in dismay as the FBI was shaken by revelations about Cointelpro, the counterintelligence program that allowed agents to spy on, burgle, 
Investigators said Kopp's car was seen near the Amherst, N.Y., home of Dr. Barnett Slepian in the weeks before the doctor, whose work at an abortion clinic had long made him a target of harassment, was killed. The officials said that Attorney General Janet Reno would soon announce that the Justice Department, aiming to heighten the visibility of the federal role in cases that cross state and local jurisdictional boundaries, would revive a national investigative effort focused on abortion clinic violence. Law enforcement officials said that the unit's operation did 
There is speculation the sniper's timing is linked to Remembrance Day because some anti-abortion activists use the day to commemorate aborted fetuses. Three times since 1994, a sniper has used this time of year to fire into the home of a Canadian doctor who performs abortion, each time wounding the target. Marilyn Wilson, executive director of the Canadian Abortion Rights Action League, sees a long-term threat because fear of violence may intimidate young doctors from entering the field.
In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages, James Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him, according to former leaders of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of anonymity. After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's Binghamton headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as the group's power 
Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion clinics here before Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for the rowdy Spring of Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only the violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and patients. Similar bands of protesters march in front of abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local protesters are often joined by bands of people who roam the country.
On the eve of a holiday that has been linked to antiabortion violence, the authorities on Tuesday were investigating whether a picture of an aborted fetus sent to a Canadian newspaper was connected to last month's fatal shooting of a Buffalo, N.Y. doctor who provided abortions or four similar attacks in western New York and Canada since 1994. The newspaper, the Hamilton (Ontario) Spectator, has received five similar packages in the last year, some containing veiled threats and several delivered by a man who employees said resembled James Charles Kopp, 
``If you're well off and well connected, you can get your abortion,'' said Dr. Stephen Wear, co-director of the center for clinical ethics at the University of Buffalo, which trains doctors for the Buffalo area's hospitals. Only in cosmopolitan and comparatively liberal cities like New York does the availability of abortions continue at a steady level, experts say, though even in these locales there is concern about the decreasing number of young doctors who emerge from residencies fully trained in performing abortions. The Guttmacher Institute, 
Abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn speak of attending peaceful observances at abortion clinics and offering prayers for the unborn. Weslin and the other house guests of Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn come recommended from friends and members of local Catholic churches, they said, adding that most are speakers at local churches or anti-abortion events. Slepian's death has abortion opponents like Mrs. Hayes and Mrs. Quinn worried, both about how the killing is being portrayed in the media and what it will do to membership in groups like the Lambs 
So when he was killed Oct. 23 by a sniper's bullet fired through the kitchen window of his home in the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs, a furtive execution that fit a pattern of four earlier attacks on abortion providers in western New York state and Canada, friends and relatives wondered not so much that Slepian's work could arouse such murderous violence. In interviews with friends and family members, he emerges as more than a one-dimensional abstract _ a conservative who advocated old-fashioned values like self-reliance, a 
James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics. The portrait that emerges of Kopp, 44, from police records, studies by researchers on right-wing movements, newspaper accounts of protests, and abortion rights advocates, is that of an itinerant protester, moving about the country in a series of 
Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize. Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula. ``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the Portuguese language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair, speaking through an interpreter. Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country and he hoped winning the 
A day after winning the Nobel Prize for literature, Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago insisted that while he was delighted to win the award, it could just as easily have gone to many other Portuguese writers. Meanwhile in Portugal, where Saramago is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday, the delight at the Swedish Academy's award for Saramago was reflected in the daily papers, with even the country's three daily sports papers ample space to the event. ``Nothing in my life would have led one to think I'd win the Nobel Prize
Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize. According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.'' The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12, the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt.
Looking at the process from afar, Harold Bloom, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, said the award committee has an unsettling record of selections that are ``nationally 'correct' and politically 'correct.''' Spain's Nobel hopes are pinned on Francisco Ayala, 92, winner of this year's renowned Prince of Asturias prize, said Jose Maria Martinez Cachero, an author, university professor and secretary of the jury that selected Ayala. Other presumed Latin candidates are Peru-born Mario Vargas Llosa, 
Jose Saramago, a 75-year-old Portuguese writer who took up literature relatively late in life and whose richly imaginative novels soon won him a following of loyal readers across Europe and vocal admirers in the United States, was awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature Thursday by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. His latest book available in English, ``Blindness,'' in which all but one of his characters mysteriously become blind, was described as his ``symphonic new novel'' by Andrew Miller in The New York Times Book Review on 
When Alfred Nobel wrote the directions establishing a literature prize in his name, he chose an unclear word and scratched out a few letters. The prize focuses intense media attention on the Swedish capital and the clamor of journalists generally drowns out a question: Why does the world care so much about the literary choices of a handful of people in a quiet and remote country? Nobel's will says the prize should recognize literature that works ``in an ideal direction.''
Three American researchers on Monday won the Nobel Medicine Prize for discovering how nitric oxide acts as a signal molecule in the cardiovascular system, a breakthrough with applications ranging from hardening of the arteries to impotence. Among other well-known names to receive the prize is David Baltimore, although he shared the prize in 1975, long before becoming one of the world's most visible AIDS researchers. The physics and chemistry prizes will be announced Tuesday, the economics prize on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who seems a perennial Nobel Peace Prize also-ran, could have won the coveted honor in 1978 had it not been for strict deadline rules for nominations. ``The Nobel committee wanted to give the prize to all three,'' said Geir Lundestad, the current committee's nonvoting secretary, said on Sunday. The Camp David accords were not signed until Sept. 17, 1978, about five weeks before that year's peace prize was annouCkuld not give him the prize, the Norwegian committee recognized in 
Furchgott concluded that blood vessels widen because the endothelial cells produce a signal molecule that he called EDRF, for endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which relaxes smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN BEGIN HERE) In his early training at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Murad worked in the laboratory of Dr. Theodore Rall, who also trained another Nobel prize winner, Dr. Alfred Gilman of the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas. But for many years, most of the scientific community was skeptical of the ability of 
He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday. His tenacity holds despite the summary trials and harsh punishments for Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin _ prominent party principals from the provinces who were sentenced to 11 and 12 years _ and despite threatening signs from the ruling Communist Party. The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party of its more influential members, Zha said.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.'' Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a 
By arresting and convicting Xu, Qin and Wang in less than three weeks, China trampled its own legal safeguards for criminal suspects and raised questions about its commitments to U.N. rights treaties it signed over the past 15 months. Four elder members of the dissident community sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.N. human rights commissioner Mary Robinson calling on China to stop persecuting political critics and release political prisoners. ``We have experienced extreme disappointment, worry and shock'' over the long sentences given Xu, Qin and Wang 
Six months after President Clinton traveled to Beijing and challenged China's leaders to move rapidly toward political reform, the administration's policy of engaging Beijing was called into question Monday when Chinese courts sentenced three of the nation's most prominent dissidents to long jail sentences. Given Clinton's effusive praise for China's senior leaders during his trip to Beijing last summer, the administration found itself on the defensive Monday and harshly criticized the prison sentences, even as it continued to insist that the administration's policy of engagement was helping push Beijing toward 
As police moved against Xu's friends, labor rights campaigner Liu Nianchun was taken from a prison camp outside Beijing and, with his wife and daughter, was put on a plane to Canada and then New York, his first taste of freedom in more than 3 1/2 years. ``The Chinese government continues to play hostage politics with no true commitment to international human rights standards,'' said Xiao Qiang of Human Rights in China, a New York-based lobbying group that Liu Qing heads. In a sign of the opposition 
In stern judgments capping a decisive crackdown on dissidents, Chinese courts sentenced two prominent democracy campaigners to 13 and 11 years in prison Monday for trying to organize an opposition political party. Judges in Beijing and Hangzhou found that Xu and Wang plotted subversion by founding branches of the China Democracy Party in both cities and accepting money from abroad, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a rare mention of dissident activities. Wang Youcai, a student leader of the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrations in 1989 and now 32, publicly declared the China Democracy 
After a trial that lasted just three and a half hours, Xu Wenli _ at 55 the dean of the dissident movement, and a man who has already spent 12 years in prison for advocating democracy _ was sentenced to 13 years for ``subversion of state power.'' In the last several months, sensing a new opportunity to speak out and making constant use of fax machines and e-mail, he and Qin tried to draw attention to China's obligations under two international covenants it has signed _ one on economic and 
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who drew China's anger recently by meeting with exiled dissident Wei Jingsheng, said China's sentencing of two dissidents Monday was unacceptable and flouted an international treaty the country recently signed. ``The reaction of Chinese authorities is totally unacceptable,'' Fischer said, calling for the dissidents' immediate release. ``The accused simply tried through peaceful means to exercise their right to free speech and assembly, which are guaranteed by China's constitution,'' and by the United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and

After 3 1/2 years in prison, Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Canadian Air flight, ultimately bound for New York, his mother and brother said. Authorities released Liu on medical parole, exactly five months before the end of his prison term, provided he go into exile, said his brother and exiled democracy campaigner, Liu Qing. ``I am very happy for Liu Nianchun, but at the same time sending people directly from 
The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. In her first comprehensive review of U.S.-Russian relations since Primakov was confirmed as prime minister last month, Albright said Washington was ``deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate. The United States must keep up its aid to Russia but is adjusting it 
If the Communist Party has its way _ and it has been planning for months _ millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years. The Communists, who have undergone a sort of resurgence by playing on the discontent, are working hard to cast themselves as outsiders in the government that they help run _ and to keep the focus of the protests on Wednesday on Yeltsin and his policies. In a survey of 1,714 people that was released last week the All-Russian Public Opinion 
Ukraine's parliament on Friday refused to approve President Leonid Kuchma's decree establishing a state fund to compensate people for savings lost in banks. The fund Kuchma proposed to establish would have accumulated money in a special National Bank account and repay people in case the bank they kept their savings in went bankrupt or became insolvent. Although the decree provided for compensation of deposits amounting only to 500 hryvna (dlrs 147 at the current exchange rate), its authors said it would cover more than 90 percent of Ukrainians who keep their money in 
The state Railway Ministry refuses to carry more mail until the Post Office makes good on some 210 million rubles in old bills _ about $13 million in today's dollars, or $35 million in dollars six weeks ago. Air mail, which amounts to one of every four or five letters, was also suspended at one of Moscow's major airports until this week, when the Post Office coughed up 5 million rubles for old bills. The Railways Ministry's spokeswoman, Ms. Pashkova, said such ``commercial cargoes'' are 
Twelve months later, as the same financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens next in Latin America.

Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares falling 1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling sharply in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates unchanged. Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows for the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down 5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent. ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive 
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country, his spokesman said Friday. The remarks came after media reports of a government economic plan in the works that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, and institute other strict economic controls, rolling back seven years of reforms. IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the loan is given
President Leonid Kuchma called Friday for ``corrections'' to Ukraine's program of market reforms, but pledged that reforms would continue. Yushchenko has warned that the bank would not spend its dwindling reserves to support the hryvna currency, but has avoided comments on the currency in recent days. The hryvna has been trading at 3.4 to the dollar in recent days but trading has been limited.
``Privatization will be accomplished for growth of production, growth of investment and growth of production effectiveness through renewal of major funds,'' Primakov said during a meeting of Western businessmen. Primakov reassured the businessmen, members of the prime minister's consultive council on foreign investment in Russia, that the government had no plans to ban the circulation of U.S. dollars in Russia. Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said the reports ``absolutely do not correspond 
Maslyukov's plan also implies that Russians would be able to buy dollars at exchanges through the country. ``The rumors of the state's becoming a monopolist on the inflow of hard currency into the country is nonsense,'' he said, asserting that the document published by Kommersant Daily was just one of six possible plans. He may be worried that the plan would would set off the panic buying of dollars, further depressing the ruble.
The Philippine ambassador to Malaysia said Friday he was summoned to the Malaysian Foreign Ministry to explain his president's statements in support of dissident Anwar Ibrahim. Ambassador Jose Brillantes said in a radio interview from Kuala Lumpur that he was called Thursday after the Malaysian dissident's eldest daughter met Philippine President Joseph Estrada. Estrada has expressed support for Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend, and indicated he may not attend a summit of Asia Pacific Rim nations in Malaysia next month.
After an unusual, one-on-one chat Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian presidents were considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim. Habibie may also stay away, his foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast Asian leaders held a half-hour private meeting. If Habibie passes up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he has difficulty leaving the country while there is no vice president, while there are 
A group of high-powered U.S. investors in Southeast Asia on Monday applauded efforts to perk up Thailand's staggering economy, saying they had been assured by top Thai officials that key economic reform packages will soon be approved. After meetings with Thai Cabinet members, including Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, members of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council said they were confident in the future of Thailand's economy and promised their companies would continue to invest here and elsewhere in the region. ``We would be quick as observers to applaud the aggressiveness 
The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. The party leaders, who have been conducting a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks of 
Now, though, Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life into the country's moribund economy. ``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital controls, the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research organization here that helped draft the policies. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves was merely due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated that 
Top finance officials from 14 countries in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to restore stability. The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an agreement reached last November that aims to promote regional economic stability. Meanwhile, Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that the country's prime minister would declare ``a state of emergency'' after the APEC meeting ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said 
Again bowing to Chinese pressure, Taiwan will send its chief economic planner to represent President Lee Teng-hui at November's Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit in Kuala Lumpur, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. Lee decided to send Chiang Pin-kung to the informal leaders summit on Nov. 17-18 after ``giving much thought'' to an invitation from Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the ministry said. Presentation of an invitation to Lee by the host nation _ with the understanding that it will be politely refused _ is an 
The trial will be interrupted during the Nov. 12-18 APEC meetings, but Mahathir's treatment of Anwar and his reform movement already have been criticized by APEC members such as Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United States. John S. Wolf, the U.S. ambassador for APEC, recently acknowledged that it won't be easy for APEC members to meet in Malaysia as the Asian crisis ``ricochets around the world with no clear sign what will happen next.'' Besides the United States, APEC, which accounts for half of 
The agenda might be global, but the menu will be Malaysian when world leaders meet next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Spicy delicacies on the menu are satay kajang, a beef or chicken kebab in peanut sauce; ayam percik, chicken curry with chilies; soto ayam, a Malaysian chicken soup, and fried rice ``village-style,'' the Star newspaper reported in Monday editions. Desert will be simple: fresh tropical fruit, said Maleia Marsden, general manager of the Cyberview Lodge, where the 
Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. Like Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international affairs circuit.
Last year, in a survey of almost 4,000 Massachusetts high school students, 22 percent of gay respondents said they skipped school in the past month because they felt unsafe at school, and 31 percent said they had been threatened or injured at school in the past year. Surveys of gay college students conducted in the late 1980s at Yale University, Oberlin College, Rutgers University and Penn State found that 16 percent to 26 percent had been threatened with violence, and that 40 percent to 76 percent had been verbally harassed, said the 
Matthew Wayne Shepard, the gay student who was beaten in the dead of night, tied to a fence and left to die alone, was mourned at his funeral Friday by 1,000 people, including many who had never met him.

But when he stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to the fence 18 hours earlier. A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot, 2-inch man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter Boulden, a friend of Shepard's. The police commander said that when his officers arrested the two men on Thursday, they found

On the same day Americans learned last week that Matthew Shepard, a 5-foot-2, 105-pound gay college student, had been tortured, strung up like an animal and left to die on a fence outside Laramie, Wyo., the Family Research Council was co-hosting a press conference in Washington. Two weeks after James Byrd was savagely dragged to his death from a pickup truck in Texas in June, I wrote a column about an ugly incident outside the GOP state convention in Fort Worth, where a mob threatened a group of 
On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming parade, ``Pistol Pete'' and his uniformed brass band were overshadowed by a larger group of marchers _ 450 people, many wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of the 21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffered severe head injuries in the attack last week. Last week's brutal assault bubbled out of an ongoing climate of hostility toward gay men and lesbians, leaders of the local Unitarian church said in a letter published Sunday in the city's newspaper
Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile (82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. That is in addition to least another 600 people elsewhere in the country, Bolanos said.
The storm's power was easing and by 1200 GMT, it had sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), down from 100 mph (160 kph) around midnight and well below its 180 mph (290 kph) peak of early Tuesday. After remaining virtually stationary for more than a day, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Thursday the center of the 350-mile-wide (560-kilometer-wide) storm had moved slightly to the south but remained just off the Honduran coast. With the storm seemingly anchored off Honduras, 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved 6.4 million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for thousands of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in Central America. The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage, the EU executive Commission said in a statement. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent of the population _ were forced to 
In Washington on Thursday, President Bill Clinton ordered dlrs 30 million in Defense Department equipment and services and dlrs 36 million in food, fuel and other aid be sent to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. The White House also said Clinton was dispatching Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to Central America on a mission to show the U.S. commitment to providing humanitarian relief. Mexico was sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, at least 12 helicopters, four cargo planes and 475 soldiers to 
Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people. It also was only 30 miles (50 kms) off the coast, and hurricane-force winds stretched outward 105 miles (165 kms); tropical storm-force winds 175 miles (280 kms). ``The hurricane has destroyed almost everything,'' said Mike Brown, a resident of Guanaja Island which was within miles 
Honduras braced for potential catastrophe Tuesday as Hurricane Mitch roared through the northwest Caribbean, churning up high waves and intense rain that sent coastal residents scurrying for safer ground. The U.S. National Weather Service in Miami said Mitch could weaken somewhat, but warned it would still remain ``a very dangerous hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.'' The Honduran president closed schools and public offices on the coast Monday and ordered all air force planes and helicopters to evacuate people from the Islas de la Bahia, a string of small islands off the country
Pope John Paul II appealed for aid Wednesday for the Central American countries stricken by hurricane Mitch and said he feels close to the thousands who are suffering. Speaking during his general audience, the pope urged ``all public and private institutions and all men of good will'' to do all they can ``in this grave moment of destruction and death.'' Hurricane Mitch killed an estimated 9,000 people throughout Central America in a disaster of such proportions that relief agencies have been overwhelmed.
At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday. Mitch _ once, 2nd graf pvs
El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died when floods swept away their homes. By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (290 kph), had dropped to near 30 mph (50 kph), and the storm _ now classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was 
U.S. President Bill Clinton requested a ``global relief effort'' to help Central America and boosted U.S. emergency aid to dlrs 70 million. Clinton is dispatching a delegation next week led by Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to deliver some of the supplies destined for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. Taiwan said today it will donate dlrs 2.6 million in relief to Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
The Republicans' new 223-211 majority (assuming a Democrat leading in Oregon holds on to win), with one independent, amounted to the smallest congressional majority since the Republican-controlled Congress of 1953, the last time Republicans controlled the House until they captured it again in 1994. Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932. Even as 
The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a revolt of white working-class Americans against what they perceived as a Democratic bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and a middle-class rejection of the politics of big government and big deficits. But old political habits and a moribund Republican leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress throughout the 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with huge budget gaps. There may indeed be a Republican majority in America
The millennial election will be fought on a political playing field whose rough outlines, if not its exact boundaries, were drawn by the voters in Tuesday's elections, which delivered a crushing disappointment to the giddy hopes of the Republicans and an unexpected elixir to the recently ailing Democrats. High-profile right-wingers lost across the country, from Attorney General Dan Lungren in the California governor's race to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, denied re-election in North Carolina, to Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin, who failed in a Senate

House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in Tuesday's midterm elections. Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise, Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term expires in January. Clinton said: ``Newt Gingrich has 
Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to deadlock the vote.'' Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones on Thursday in a 
At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken House majority, could tie the party in knots for months because it could throw the speakership to a Democrat. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in January, and there are six others who have told me they feel

Members and aides said Wednesday that a fury at the speaker had bubbled up overnight and that some members were trying to organize a slate of candidates to replace Gingrich and his leadership team when House Republicans convene on Nov. 18 to select their leaders for next year. ``I'm hoping more people will understand the need for a serious reassessment this year,'' said Rep. Charles T. Canady, R-Fla., who said he had hoped for a challenge to the speaker after the 1996 elections, when the Republicans also lost seats
A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his ``war'' on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday: He will not be muzzled. The concern among House Democrats, one expressed by some White House officials as well, was that Carville's vitriol would make the Democrats appear overly partisan and could be especially damaging to Democrats in marginal districts who do not want to appear too easy on the president. Asked to describe 
De Klerk said he would sue to block the long-awaited final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was due for release Thursday. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the truth panel's chairman, said the commission needed time to prepare to fight the legal challenge, and would ``excise'' de Klerk's name from the report to avoid delaying its release. We fought hard for those rights and we can be proud in South Africa that Mr. de Klerk now shares in them,'' he said in a statement.
A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks, the state broadcaster said Monday. South African Broadcasting Corp. radio said it had been leaked a ``preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid. An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance ``informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross 
Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F.W. While de Klerk was alone in court Wednesday challenging the commission, Tutu said Wednesday that other threatened legal challenges had led to fewer individuals being named as rights violators than originally planned. The commission had been expected to say that although de Klerk did not order the bombings, he subsequently came to know that former Law and Order 
Torturers and bombers who carried out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for South Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday. Addressing local and international experts, Charles Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially dangerous sector of society. Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorders, said de Kock typified many killers from all sides in the conflict by his 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1: The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the most comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past that any such commission has yet produced. Drawing from the commission's own investigations and the testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims, the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era, and blames successive white governments for the vast majority. Besides accusing the government of 
President Nelson Mandela acknowledged Saturday the African National Congress violated human rights during apartheid, setting him at odds with his deputy president over a report that has divided much of South Africa. But it also blamed the ANC for gross human rights violations during its anti-apartheid struggle, saying the group tortured suspected spies and dissidents and killed innocent civilians with land mines and bombs. Mbeki _ who became ANC president last year and will likely be elected South Africa's next president in 1999 when Mandela retires _ took a hard line Saturday against 
Criminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against white rule could drag on for at least six years, a top prosecutor said Monday. Key figures implicated in human rights abuses by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission already are under investigation, the official, Jan d'Oliveira, told reporters. The remarks by d'Oliveira, who recently was appointed a deputy national director of prosecutions, were the clearest signal yet that criminal cases would be brought against figures accused by the commission of gross human rights violations.
Following are excerpts from the final report issued by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday: PRIMARY FINDING On the basis of the evidence available to it, the primary finding of the Commission is that: The predominant portion of gross violations of human rights was committed by the former state through its security and law-enforcement agencies.

It seems that nearly all of South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock because of the report. ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe said it was ``premature'' to talk of a general amnesty, but he acknowledged that the party was discussing an amnesty specifically tailored to violence by black South Africans against other blacks that littered the KwaZulu/Natal province with bodies during the late '80s and into the '90s. One thing seems clear, however: Four 
The institution exploring apartheid's horrors will issue a report that finds the African National Congress shares blame for human rights violations as it struggled to overcome white rule. Indeed, news reports Monday said the Truth Commission would declare apartheid a crime against humanity and acknowledge that the ANC and the more radical Pan Africanist Congress were conducting a legitimate struggle against the former apartheid state. But in preliminary findings sent to the parties last month, the commission also said the two movements were ``morally and politically accountable'' for gross rights violations, South 
Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run Libyan radio reported. Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent 
After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too distant future.'' He credited Annan's talks with Omar al-Muntasser, Libya's foreign minister, who met with Annan in Sirte before Annan went on to talks with Gadhafi.

Qatar's foreign minister, Sheik Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani, met Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in the desert on Saturday, Libya's official television reported. The television, monitored in Cairo, did not say where the meeting took place, but it showed Gadhafi, dressed in a muddy brown gown and matching cap, receiving the Qatari minister in a tent. Al Thani handed Gadhafi a letter that reaffirmed Qatar's support for Libya ``in its just position toward the so-called Lockerbie case,'' the television said
After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the ``not too distant future.''

Security Council resolutions. Annan's meeting with Gadhafi took place after Libya's official news agency, JANA
A Western diplomat, speaking in Algiers on condition of anonymity, said Annan would travel to Libya on Saturday to meet with authorities there on the 1988 Pan Am bombing that has led to U.N. sanctions against Libya. The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992, including a flight ban, to try to force Libya to hand over two suspects in the bombing that killed 270 people. A Libyan legal team has been meeting regularly with Annan's legal counsel to discuss a U.S.-British proposal to try the suspects in the Netherlands according 
Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial. ``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional trial, therefore this exception should include serving the jail term in Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' al-Zuwiy said. Opening the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the background to the controversy since the Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the 
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. Annan's one-day visit to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi followed reports in the Libyan media that Gadhafi had no authority to hand over the suspects.

Earlier in the day, Prince Philip, the queen's husband, laid a wreath in 
Leaders from 19 Latin American nations, Spain and Portugal put finishing touches Saturday on an Ibero-American summit declaration warning of global recession unless action is taken to stabilize the international financial system. Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said Saturday that Brazil and China, two of the world's largest economies, had become the ``dikes of resistance'' to global recession. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on the United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank 
The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion. So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50 percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected $170 billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further. One senior administration official who deals with economic issues, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday 
Cardoso wants to impose tough measures that would slash government spending and impose new taxes to try to halt the slide in Brazil's economy and restore investor confidence. Kugelmas said opponents of the president stand a good chance of winning in four large states _ Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. Sao Paulo, Brazil's industrial and financial powerhouse, is perhaps the state most critical to the success of Cardoso's austerity plans.
Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz has promised civil service raises, bonuses and new jobs that his opponent estimates would cost some dlrs 1 billion.
Latin American leaders flew Friday to Portugal for a weekend summit to figure out how they can shield their economies from the global financial crisis. The heads of state and government from Latin America, Spain and Portugal will explore measures to ward off the financial turmoil that already has devastated Asia and Russia. The declaration ``calls on the international community, and Group of Seven countries in particular, to take the necessary measures to promote stability in international financial markets, which is a necessary condition for sustained economic growth,'' said Luis Augusto 
The United States is preparing to commit U.S. taxpayer funds as part of a lending program of at least $30 billion to try to insulate Brazil, and with it the rest of Latin America, from the worst effects of the financial turmoil circling the globe, according to U.S. and foreign officials assembling the program. Direct U.S. aid to Brazil would clearly send a symbolic message: that after a year of trying to manage the financial crisis through the monetary fund, the United States is now ready to put a limited amount of its 
Some workplaces have already offered their employees such things as hammers, nails, screws and bolts instead of the traditional cash bonus that normally is equivalent to one month's wage, said the head of Brazil's largest federation of trade unions. But strapped for cash and punished by high interest rates and declining sales, factory owners may have no other choice, said Joseph Curi, president of the Sao Paulo State Association of Small Industries, which represents 110,000 factories that employ nearly 800,000 workers.

In Brasilia, officials said that among the measures being considered were a tax increase on financial transactions, to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which sets aside 20 percent of all taxes collected for presidential discretionary spending. Speaking in Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3 percent in 2001. It had already been announced, at the end of the IMF's annual meeting in 
Eager to bolster the sagging economy, Cardoso wants to slash dlrs 19 billion (23.5 billion reals) from the budget deficit, and he's beginning by paring perks for the more than 2,000 workers at the presidential palace in Brasilia, the capital. The leftist Workers Party said the government was making a big deal of insignificant savings while it failed to cut other dubious projects, such as a dlrs 800,000 (1 million reals) moat being built around Congress to keep protesters from easily entering the building. In Brasilia, Joaquim Roriz 
A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000. Despite the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term as president and the announcement Oct. 8 that Brazil and the IMF had agreed on the broad outlines of a financial assistance package, investors continued to withdraw large sums of money from Brazil. The statement reiterated Brazil's goal of achieving a primary budget surplus of 2.6 percent 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties _ previously bitter rivals _ to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by Hun Sen. Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. Hun 
Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members' return an international issue. Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition _ claiming widespread intimidation and fraud _ has denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. After a meeting between Hun Sen 
Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim, the current 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. The royalist party also rejected Hun Sen's calls to hold bilateral talks, insisting that Ranariddh's main ally Sam Rainsy also be included. ``No party with seats at the National Assembly should be left out if transparency and a check and balance system is to be used in government,'' the statement said, adding that the Sam Rainsy Party 
The Cambodian People's Party criticized a non-binding resolution passed earlier this month by the U.S. House of Representatives calling for an investigation into violations of international humanitarian law allegedly committed by Hun Sen. Events mentioned in the resolution include Hun Sen's coup last year against his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and his violent crackdown in September against anti-government demonstrations. ``The CPP would like to launch an appeal to U.S. senators to wisely and realistically consider this draft resolution and give justice to the CPP, Hun Sen 
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. Hun Sen and Ranariddh are scheduled to meet Nov. 23 _ two days before parliament reopens _ to review the results of the working groups and give their final approval, Ahmad Yahya said. Sam Rainsy said he had been told by Ranariddh that his party and former Khmer Rouge guerrillas had been implicated by Hun Sen in a rocket attack on the Sept. 
The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life. But a deal reached between Hun Sen and his chief rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on forming a new government last week has opened the door for their return. Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition 
``Papa will not preside over any summit meeting between the three parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result,'' Sihanouk wrote in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. Hun Sen used Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with his party. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians following two alleged attempts 
Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 25, but complained that Hun Sen's assurances were not strong enough to ease concerns his party members may be arrested upon their return to Cambodia. Sam Rainsy, who earlier called Hun Sen's statement ``full of loopholes,'' asked Sihanouk for 
Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to ``internationalize'' the political crisis. Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed. Opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition figures after two alleged attempts on his life, said they could not negotiate freely 
Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president. All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor. Lahoud is to be sworn for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
A Cabinet minister and a close Syria ally on Wednesday criticized the Syrian-backed choice of the army commander as president, and said he will boycott a vote to elect the military man for the executive post. Walid Jumblatt, the minister for displaced persons, said he and his party's three legislators will not vote when the 128-member Parliament elects the president, likely sometime before Oct. 23. Like Jumblatt, some in Lebanon fear that a military man as president could mean intelligence agents will track civilian life just as they did between 
The commander of Lebanon's army will become the country's next president after winning the crucial backing of Syria, the powerbroker in Lebanon. ``Congratulations, your excellency the general,'' Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri told army commander Emile Lahoud in a telephone conversation Monday that was headlined on the front-page of the leftist newspaper As-Safir. Lahoud, elevated from rear admiral to general and appointed army commander in 1988 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the business tycoon who launched Lebanon's multibillion dollar reconstruction from the devastation of civil war, said Monday he was bowing out as premier following a dispute with the new president. Hariri's move could be a ploy to gain more power as a new government is formed, but the crisis atmosphere generated by the possible departure of the billionaire businessman could affect Lebanon's economic recovery. In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultations.

Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's efforts to win a fourth term in office have hit a snag after he failed to receive the expected speedy appointment from new President Emile Lahoud. Hariri is still the front-runner to form the next government but Saturday's Daily Star newspaper quoted sources as saying that Hariri was ``outraged'' that only 62 of the 128 members in Parliament declared their support for him during a meeting with Lahoud Friday. Hariri, who has been prime minister since 1992, was appointed three times during the extended term of 
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.

Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as president. The 128-member legislature is expected to meet Thursday to elect Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs the constitutional amendment. Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander an historic chance to make a lasting peace on the peninsula. In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious underground site, which American intelligence officials fear could be a secret effort to revive the North's nuclear weapons program. ``Nothing could ever 
But, speaking at a joint appearance with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, Clinton called the requested documents ``quite important'' and said Iraq had ``some affirmative obligations'' to help weapons inspectors. Last weekend, Clinton called off a strike against Iraq minutes before it was to begin, delayed his departure for Asia to monitor the crisis and said that U.S. forces remained poised to strike if Iraq reneged on its agreement to let U.N. weapons inspectors do their work. As Clinton and Kim delivered prepared statements and answered questions Saturday, 
Sunday, hours after he called off an attack on Iraq, Clinton finally volunteered the obvious, that the focus of U.S. policy toward Iraq is the removal of President Saddam Hussein _ what Clinton called supporting the ``forces of change in Iraq.'' The bigger surprise came Monday, when polite-to-a-fault Al Gore used his visit to Malaysia for an Asian economic summit meeting to throw U.S. support behind protesters calling for ``reformasi,'' the code word on the streets of Kuala Lumpur for dumping Prime Minister Mahathir 
A South Korean lawmaker said Friday communist North Korea could be producing plutonium and could have more secret underground nuclear facilities than already feared. He said in a Parliament session that one of them is believed to already be producing plutonium and the other would be able to produce enough for 10 nuclear bombs starting around 2004. It was activity at Yongbyon that prompted the United States to negotiate a 1994 accord promising development of two light-water reactors and fuel-oil shipments if North Korea would halt nuclear weapons development.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton won South Korea's support Saturday for confronting North Korea over a suspected nuclear site, and he warned the North's communist leaders not to squander a chance to achieve lasting peace on the peninsula. Clinton acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials are not yet certain that the suspicious underground construction project in North Korea is nuclear related. In meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, U.S. officials were rebuffed in their request to see the suspicious site, which American intelligence 
North Korean news media on Thursday said the communist nation's military is on full alert for war with the United States if a dispute over nuclear inspections comes to blows. The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons. The general staff of the North Korean military accused Washington on Wednesday of pushing the situation in Korea to the ``brink of war'' by demanding inspections and talks aimed at preventing Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and 
North Korea has agreed to receive a U.S. delegation next month to discuss American concerns about the construction of a vast underground complex that is widely feared to house a nuclear weapons program, the State Department said on Wednesday. The official North Korean press agency said last week that the government was building ``civilian underground structures on which any `doubt' cannot be cast'' and suggested that American officials would be allowed to inspect the complex if they pressed for access. In addition the White House disclosed that the United States would provide 
North Korea has demanded that the United States pay hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect a huge underground center that U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials said Wednesday. The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang Guk, said last week that the United States could inspect the site ``on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering and defaming my country.'' U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by 
A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years. North Korea does not release mortality figures or health statistics, but Hall said that the United Nations had gathered and would soon release data indicating that 30 percent of North Korean children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and that 67 percent of all children are physically stunted. While Eberstadt counsels caution, that could mean 
In a green aviator jacket and black cap, President Clinton spent Sunday visiting American troops stationed in South Korea. For all his eagerness to talk about information-age economic dangers like quicksilver currency flows, Clinton has returned again and again during his five-day trip to Japan and South Korea to the old-style regional military threat posed by North Korea. He pointed to talks that began over the summer between the American military command in Korea and the North Korean military to prevent problems along the demilitarized zone between the south and 
The proposed deal is a complex, three-way transaction involving AOL, Netscape and Sun Microsystems Inc. AOL, the leading on-line service with more than 14 million subscribers, would acquire Netscape's popular site on the World Wide Web and its software business. AOL would also enter into a joint marketing and development partnership with Sun Microsystems to strengthen Netscape's other business of selling to large corporations the heavy-duty software needed to serve up Web pages and other Internet technologies to many thousands of users at the same time.

The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft believe that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows Gates saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet software market. It showed a few brief clips of a point 
Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that it will enter an entirely new market: working behind the computer screen to help companies open and operate online stores.

Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems. Warren-Boulton's purpose on the stand for the government is to establish that Microsoft does have a monopoly in operating-system software; more than 90 percent of the world's computers use a Microsoft operating system
But for America Online _ and for the big Internet players against which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies further down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200 each, or maybe included free as part of a subscription service, just as some cellular phones are now. ``But these people want to change the world, and we've got to be clear that joining with America Online, 
In addition, only a couple of years ago America Online, the world's biggest online service, was having so much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely derided as ``America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved so aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed forward to make deals with other Internet players. Now in the corridors outside the antitrust trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape has found a new partner in America Online and 
America Online Inc. wants to become the ``next Microsoft'' in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company _ the Internet media business and electronic commerce.

Throughout the morning, Arafat walked from the lounge to the tarmac seven times to greet planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Spain, the European Union and two Palestinian Airlines flights. Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. A Palestinian industrial park between Gaza and Israel is to open next month, while Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on a Palestinian seaport in Gaza are continuing.
As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. After touring the airport Thursday, a U.S. official said more work was needed to be done before the airport was ready for Clinton.
Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, marking the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process. Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane Sunday afternoon, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority, according to Civilian Airport Authority Director Nir Yarkoni. The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
A plane bound for Amman, Jordan was delayed for two hours over an Israeli demand that Palestinian officials inspect the luggage of a Palestinian passenger, Israel radio reported. Earlier this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his entourage were aboard the plane in question, and that exempted the plane from Israeli

The Palestinians, in turn, accuse Israel of reneging on an agreement to release Palestinians jailed for anti-Israel activities.
The airport opening had been held up for two years because of disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's role in monitoring passengers and cargo. Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza, said periodic security closures, which bar Palestinians from entering Israel, would not effect the operation of the airport. Palestinian officials say the equipment for the control tower, the computers for the check-in counters and the flood lights are still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
Last weekend, the Palestinians inaugurated an airport in the Mediterranean city of Gaza under the U.S.-brokered Wye River accord which envisages Israel ceding more lands to the Palestinians in return for security guarantees. Jasser Ziyyad, director-general of the Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority, said Jordan agreed with the Palestinians earlier in the week on four weekly flights between them _ two by the Palestinian airline and two for Jordan. Meanwhile, Jordanian newspapers quoted unnamed Palestinian aviation officials as saying one more passenger plane will be added to the Palestinian fleet of 
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. ``Despite everything that has been written, this is not a decision for the British government or the Spanish government,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an interview published by a Spanish newspaper on Wednesday. ``Depending on the result of the appeals it is possible that it (the extradition request) will never reach the government so perhaps the government will never have to 
The Swiss government has ordered no investigation of possible bank accounts belonging to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a spokesman said Wednesday. Weekend newspaper reports in Spain said a Spanish judge who ordered Pinochet's arrest has issued a petition aimed at freezing any accounts the 82-year-old general might have in Luxembourg and Switzerland. But government spokesman Achille Casanova said no accounts have so far been frozen in Switzerland and no investigation order has been given to federal banking authorities.
Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule. El Mundo said its reporter accompanied Chilean politicians seeking his release during a visit to the clinic Thursday. Meanwhile, a Chilean television station reported Friday that a Chilean army officer close to Pinochet told the former military chief about his situation after flying to London Thursday.
A delegation of Chilean legislators lobbying against the possible extradition of Augusto Pinochet to Spain to face trial, warned Thursday that Chile was on the brink of political turmoil. On Thursday the head prosecutor from the National Court set in motion appeals against several rulings made by Judge Garzon related to Pinochet's detention in the London clinic where he was recovering from back surgery. The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon
Cuban President Fidel Castro said Sunday he disagreed with the arrest in London of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, calling it a case of ``international meddling.'' Castro, Latin America's only remaining authoritarian leader, said he lacked details on the case against Pinochet, but said he thought it placed the government of Chile and President Eduardo Frei in an uncomfortable position while Frei is attending the summit. Castro joked that he would have thought police could have waited another 24 hours to avoid having the arrest of Pinochet overshadow the summit being 
The wife of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet appealed for his release, saying he is too sick to be extradited to Spain to face charges of genocide. ''This is very painful for our family,'' a tearful Lucia Pinochet told reporters late Friday outside the private London Clinic, where her husband is under arrest as he recuperates from back surgery. He was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited. In London, where Pinochet has been under arrest in a clinic for the last 10 days, a phalanx of British lawyers argued before the High Court of Justice that the arrest order sent from Spain was illegal because the general, 82, is not a Spanish citizen. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest 
The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities and they will not interfere. ``Both myself and Mr. Aznar agree this is not a matter for us to discuss,'' British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, referring to Spanish leader Jose Maria Aznar. Aznar dismissed reports that the bid to try Pinochet will damage Spain's relations with Latin America.
Britain has defended its arrest of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, with one lawmaker saying that Chile's claim that the former Chilean dictator has diplomatic immunity is ridiculous. British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973. The envoy sent to London to argue for Pinochet's release, Santiago Benadava, would offer only diplomatic advice, said Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza.
Margaret Thatcher entertained former Children dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet at her home two weeks before he was arrested in his bed in a London hospital, the ex-prime minister's office said Tuesday, amid growing diplomatic and domestic controversy over the move. Chilean Ambassador Mario Artaza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, said Chile had a duty to protect a citizen with diplomatic immunity and senator status. Pinochet, expected to be hospitalized for perhaps two more weeks faces a long battle through British courts to avoid extradition, questioning by two 
The chances for a new, strictly secular government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power. Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller, the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him Wednesday. But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces with Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal.
Opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions Wednesday against Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz after allegations he interfered in the privatization of a bank and helped a businessman linked to a mobster. Afterward, Baykal said the Republicans would support a no-confidence motion. The leader of the Democratic Turkey Party, Husamettin Cindoruk, said his party might withdraw from the governing coalition.
Parliament convened Thursday to vote on whether to move toward a no-confidence motion that could bring down the government over an organized crime scandal. Thursday's vote to put the motion on the agenda will be an indication of the government's chances of survival, which are said to be extremely slim. ``Ousting the government from power will open the way for the struggle against gangs,'' said Lutfu Esengun, a deputy from the Islamic Virtue Party, which presented one of the three no-confidence motions to Parliament.
A week after the Turkish government fell in a corruption scandal, President Suleyman Demirel on Wednesday asked a veteran left-wing politician known for his personal honesty, Bulent Ecevit, to form a new government. Ecevit, who served as prime minister three times in the 1970s, said he would immediately begin working to fashion a government that could command a majority in the faction-ridden Parliament. The commanders are also hoping to exclude two of the country's leading politicians, outgoing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller
Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Refusing any alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime 
Turkey's latest premier-designate got the backing of two key secular parties Monday in his efforts to form a broad-based, coalition government, on condition that his government stick to Turkey's secular principles. Erez, an independent lawmaker, is trying to form a coalition government that would include Cabinet members from several parties, including Virtue. Erez took over efforts to form a government last week after veteran leftist Bulent Ecevit gave up, unable to convince Turkey's bickering center-left and center-right parties to join him 
Bulent Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, is a former prime minister best remembered for ordering an invasion of Cyprus in 1974 that made him an overnight hero at home. Throughout the years, Ecevit, 73, has remained a strong defender of the cause of the Turkish Cypriots ``As long as Turkey lives, we won't allow the oppression and subordination of Turkish Cypriots at the hands of Greek Cypriots,'' he said in July 1997 during the 23rd anniversary celebrations of the invasion. He was imprisoned 
The allegations were made by businessman Korkmaz Yigit, who claimed that Yilmaz and Gunes Taner, the economy minister, had encouraged him to buy the state-run bank Turkbank, offering him loans from other state banks to ensure that his offer was the highest bid. Yigit claimed Yilmaz and Taner were aware of Cakici's involvement in the bidding for the bank but urged him nevertheless to go ahead with the bidding. Yilmaz has said that an intelligence report revealing Yigit's ties with Cakici only reached him after Yigit won the tender.
President Suleyman Demirel appeared likely to turn to some widely trusted lawmaker to form Turkey's next government, after a veteran politician abandoned efforts Monday to persuade bickering political leaders to support him in a pro-secular coalition. ``It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence,'' former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel. By tradition, Demirel should then have asked the leader of Parliament's largest party to form a new government.
Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition. Ecevit, who was asked to form a new government Wednesday, desperately needs the support of the 99 deputies of ex-premier Tansu Ciller's center-right party. Ecevit, a veteran leftist, already has the support of another center-right party led by Mesut Yilmaz, whose government collapsed last week under the weight of a mafia scandal.
Since cancerous cells were found in one of the 36 lymph nodes removed from his abdomen during the operation, Strawberry said doctors told him he will need six months of chemotherapy treatment once he returns to California. Although the discovery of cancer in one lymph node proved that the cancer had spread, Strawberry remained optimistic about his future and said, ``It didn't worry me. Unlike David Wells, Saturday night's starter in the World Series who predicted the Yankees would throttle the Padres in five games, Strawberry refused to make a 
The Yankees trailed San Diego, 5-2, in the seventh inning, but Knoblauch hit a three-run home run to tie the score, and five batters later, Martinez smashed a grand slam. They loaded the bases with a single and two walks, and Ledee, the rookie left fielder who is playing because none of Torre's left fielders have been hitting, pulled a sinking fastball down the right field line with two outs. David Wells got ahead in the count, no balls and two strikes, with 
``The pressure was on to get to the World Series, so I can see all those people,'' Torre, the Yankees' manager, was saying before New York went out to play the here-we-are, let's-go-for-it San Diego Padres in the Stadium Saturday night. Bruce Bochy, the manager, a reserve on the 1984 San Diego World Series team, has said: ``A lot of the players on that team said, looking back, we wish we would have had 
Offense There were signs in the ALCS that the offense is coming out of its collective slump _ Chuck Knoblauch is getting on base consistently, Derek Jeter is back to driving the ball to right field and through the middle, Bernie Williams had three hits in Game 6, and Scott Brosius has been a consistent force at the bottom of the lineup. PITCHING TO THE PADRES Quilvio Veras: A switch-hitter who has more power right-handed; should try to pitch him down-and-in with breaking balls when he
When the Yankees defeated the Indians, 9-5, in Game 6 on Tuesday night to advance to their second World Series in three years, Knoblauch was easily the most relieved player on the field. If the Yankees had lost the ALCS, even some of Knoblauch's teammates had said that he would be branded as the villain for failing to pursue the ball that glanced off Travis Fryman's back while he was running outside the baseline. He flashed the sort of smile that he had not shown too much recently and, 
As Bernie Williams starts what could be his final series with the Yankees in Game 1 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium Saturday night, he wants to do it with a free mind. While Cashman would not discuss financial matters, another Yankee official said the team will not offer Williams as much as $12 million a year _ unless Steinbrenner gets generous after a possible championship. When a reporter asked Williams how he would respond to someone who suggested that he accept less from the Yankees to remain in a city where he is 
After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways. It would be the team's first World Series appearance since 1984, and in the downtown business district Friday, marquees and banners read ``Go Padres'' and a lunch-hour rally was attended by several 
The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 17: It is fitting that this most memorable of baseball seasons should conclude with a World Series that opens Saturday night in Yankee Stadium, the aging but still grand cathedral of the sport. That makes it the perfect venue for part of a championship series that will determine whether the 1998 Yankees are one of the greatest teams of the modern era, or just a talented squad that owned the regular season but folded in the World Series. Baseball fans, even Yankee 
All right, so Ted Hendry won't be in the World Series; the umpires' collective bargaining agreement with the leagues does not allow an umpire to work both a league championship series and the World Series. Ah yes, the last time Garcia worked a post-season series at Yankee Stadium, he was the umpire in Game 1 of the league championship series two years ago when a young fan from New Jersey _ no name, please; he has been over-glorified enough _ reached over the fence and caught Derek 
Martinez could joke about the bats being specially designed for the World Series because the Yankees began their quest for a second title in the past three years when they play host to the San Diego Padres in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium Saturday night. Even though Martinez has struggled with numerous bats during the post-season, he could joke because the Yankees are still alive for the title. He is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved team that has batted .229 
Hundreds of people gathered at Sarajevo airport on Saturday to welcome Zejnil Delalic, who was cleared of war crimes charges earlier this week after spending 980 days in jail of the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Delalic, a Muslim, was cleared of charges of war crimes committed in 1992 against Serb prisoners in the Muslim-led Bosnian Army prison camp Celebici near his hometown of Konjic. Three others involved in the same case were convicted and will serve prison terms at The Hague for crimes committed as camp guards.
Yugoslavia must cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting in Belgrade said Sunday. Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, cooperates with the tribunal in cases where Serbs were the victims in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics that fought wars for their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned the tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia.
The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities. The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal cleared Zejnil Delalic, a Muslim, of responsibility for war crimes committed against Serb captives at a Bosnian government-run prison camp under his command. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in 
American and allied forces in Bosnia on Wednesday arrested a Bosnian Serb general who was charged with genocide by the international war crimes tribunal in a recent secret indictment. Ivo Daalder, a former Bosnia expert on the National Security Council, now with the Brookings Institution, said the arrest showed a new and promising coordination between the Tribunal and NATO troops, given the rapid arrest after the Oct. 30 indictment. It was where the United Nations first made a stand in March 1993, when the commander of U.N. troops personally led a convoy of 
In its first case to deal with atrocities against Serbs during Bosnia's civil war, a U.N. war crimes tribunal on Monday convicted three prison officials and guards, but acquitted a top military commander who oversaw the facility. Esad Landzo, a Muslim guard, was convicted of killing three prisoners and torturing at least three others and was sentenced to 15 years. The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial _ Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997

The president of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal harshly criticized Belgrade authorities anew for refusing to let U.N. investigators probe alleged atrocities in Kosovo. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council released Wednesday by the tribunal, presiding judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States said the failure of Yugoslav officials to grant visas to investigators is ``an affront.'' ``The intentional and continuous refusal by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to comply with its clear and incontrovertible legal obligations to the tribunal is an affront to the Security Council and all law
Some of the closest combat in the half year of the Kosovo conflict, to the point of fighting room to room and floor to floor, occurred near this village six weeks ago, in the days before 21 women, children and elderly members of the Delijaj clan were massacred by Serbian forces, their mutilated bodies left strewn on the forest floor. ``Blood was in her mouth and her mother's hand on the baby,'' said Imer Delijaj, the father, an avowed member of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic 
To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was ``the face of genocide'' who once bragged that ``he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.'' ``Once Goran Jelisic even declined assistance from a guard, noting that he was still in `good form' even though he had killed over 60 people,'' Bowers told judges, citing statements made by witnesses due to testify later in the trial. Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted two Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and 
In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge panel that Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious offense. Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide. Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder, rape 
A senior Palestinian negotiator says the success of a peace summit this week near Washington depends on a clear-cut ``yes'' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to an American initiative. Sharon, whose appointment last week was widely seen as a bid to keep far-right allies from toppling Netanyahu's government, has been quoted as saying he would refuse to shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However, the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot said over the weekend that Netanyahu's hard-line Cabinet, due to meet Tuesday
Ariel Sharon, the hawkish former general tipped to be Israel's next foreign minister, said in an interview published Sunday that if he gets the job, he won't shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. ``Even if I will be appointed foreign minister and run the negotiations, I won't shake Yasser Arafat's hand,'' Sharon was quoted as saying in the Yediot Ahronot daily. Netanyahu himself has been acting foreign minister since the post was vacated in January by David Levy, a moderate who opposed Netanyahu's 
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. ``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.

As defense minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of Lebanon, defying international condemnation with unrelenting artillery assaults on Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee camps believed by the Israeli high command to be Palestine Liberation Organization redoubts. As a key member of the ``inner cabinet'' in Begin's first government, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967, a policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his signal domestic

The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: Just days before heading to the United States for critical negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister. As a leader of the most conservative wing of the Likud party, Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians. With his appointment, Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, is expected to quell domestic opposition to the concessions that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next week.

Representatives of exiled East Timorese pro-independence groups said Friday that Indonesian troops attacked unarmed civilians in a village in the disputed Southeast Asian territory, killing one East Timorese and wounding 22 others. The attack took place Tuesday near Cailaco in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, according to a statement issued by the pro-independence Christian Democratic Union of East Timor.

Protesters on Sunday urged Australian military leaders to identify Indonesian army officers trained here to allow closer monitoring of human rights abuses in East Timor.

The United Nations refuses to recognize the annexation as legitimate; Australia is one of the few nations that recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
In a decision welcomed as a landmark by Portugal, European Union leaders Saturday backed calls for a referendum to decide the fate of East Timor, the former Portuguese colony occupied by Indonesia since 1975. ``A definitive solution to the East Timor question will not be possible without free consultation to establish the real will of the East Timorese people,'' the 15 EU leaders said in statement after their year-end summit. Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the statement marked the first time the EU had backed Lisbon's call for the

But Ramos-Horta's previous persona non grata status had been ordered lifted by the Foreign Ministry in August, leaving no reason why he should have been refused entry by airport immigration when he came to town Wednesday night, ministry spokesman Roy Wu told a news conference. ``This sort of incident shows that Taiwan is just not qualified

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - As a U.N. envoy trotted toward an Indonesian army helicopter, East Timorese protesters spilled onto the runway tarmac and shouted their anger at nervous soldiers. ``They don't want independence tomorrow,'' said Marker, who was interviewed in a Jakarta hotel suite after his trip to East Timor. ``I said there was a lot of tension in East Timor and that he and his people ought to do everything they can to reduce it,'' said Marker, a former Pakistani ambassador to the United

Indonesia on Tuesday denied claims that its troops massacred more than 40 East Timorese recently, and criticized Portugal for suspending U.N.-sponsored talks over the future of the troubled territory. Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia in New York last week following reports of a massacre of dozens of East Timorese rebels in a series of clashes with Indonesian troops. East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, has said that between 30 and 40 people were reportedly killed near the villages of Alas and Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles
Bent on revenge for earlier attacks on churches, mobs set fire to four mosques in West Timor Monday after a protest and strike by thousands of Christians degenerated into a riot, the military and a Muslim leader said.

Anwar mounted a nationwide campaign against the prime minister before being detained as a national security risk and charged with illegal homosexual acts and corruption in connection with those allegations. It also welcomed the release of seven youth leaders, including Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the head of the youth wing of the ruling United Malays National Organization and a former ally of Anwar, who were arrested last week in connection with demonstrations in favor of the ousted deputy-premier. ``The EU expresses hope that the other political demonstrators still detained under the Internal Security 
Bruises on the face of jailed dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of Malaysian police. After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday. Three Malaysian police officers traveled to Singapore Thursday to ask CNBC news anchors how they had arranged to get the Sept. 21 interview 
The move set off street demonstrations and aroused international condemnation, particularly from Anwar's many friends in foreign governments. The day after making his economic gamble, Mahathir set off the most severe political crisis of his tenure, dismissing Anwar, the man he had been grooming to be his successor. With the emergence of this still-tentative opposition movement, the fear expressed by one Western diplomat is of a ``downward spiral'' in which ``suppression breeds more discontent breeds more suppression breeds more discontent.''
The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. The party leaders, who have been conducting a national campaign to explain to Malaysians why the popular Anwar was fired Sept. 2, will also confer on what to do now that the High Court judge has banned all comments on Anwar's guilt or innocence. Anwar was also dumped from the ruling party, and after two weeks of 
Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two weeks of rallies around Malaysia at which he called for government reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation. Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, after he had differed with Mahathir on policy for escaping economic recession. Despite the recent protests against him, Prime Minister Mahathir said Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and there have been no defections from 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor. Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward toppling him as prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National Organization. Mahathir said Anwar had arranged for his supporters to contest for and gain control of the UMNO divisions so that he could win the party's top post in next year's party elections.
The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday. In recent visits to Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she said potential investors asked her about Anwar's arrest but were still interested in investing in Malaysia. The Philippine leader said he was considering skipping a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
Although the government said police would ``check every bit of information and leaflet'' posted on the Internet, Malaysia's sole Internet provider acknowledged Friday the medium is ``impossible to control.'' Within hours of Anwar's recent speech accusing Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of cruelty and insanity, dozens of boot-legged recordings had been posted onto new websites hatched by supporters. Most of the Internet content about Anwar is false or unverifiable, but the medium is tough to rein in, said Azzman Shariffadeen, head of Mimos, the company 
In a move that could deal a major setback to the case against Anwar, Aness then filed a letter of appeal through his lawyers. We have instructions to proceed and we are proceeding,'' said Singh, adding he filed the letter of appeal in court Sept. 29. Between the visits with his client, however, Aness signed another letter saying he would not proceed with the appeal, Singh said.
Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders ``difficult'' because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister, a Thai newspaper reported Sunday. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. Like Estrada, Habibie served as his country's vice president when Anwar was deputy prime minister, making them counterparts on the international affairs circuit.
One of four foreigners beheaded by kidnappers in Chechnya claimed in a videotape shown today that he and his fellow hostages were British spies. One, Peter Kennedy, claimed they had been sent to Chechnya by the British secret service to monitor telephone conversations. Asked about the spying allegation, British Ambassador to Russia Andrew Wood said, ``We don't comment on these things in general but any reasonable analysis would show we have no wish to spy on Chechen territory.''
Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the North Ossetia region, was seized by three masked gunmen in the regional capital Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. Cochetel was freed about two minutes into the predawn operation on the border between the republics of Chechnya and Ingushetia, but a longer firefight broke out between the kidnappers and Russian security forces, the Interfax news agency said. Two security officers were slightly injured during the operation, Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said, according to the ITAR-
A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported. Vincent Cochetel, 37, who headed the regional office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in North Ossetia, was seized by three masked gunmen in the region's capital of Vladikavkaz on Jan. 29. According to the Interfax news agency, Cochetel was freed early Saturday in an operation conducted by the Russian Interior Ministry and the regional security forces of the north Caucasus.
A truck blew up when it drove over a land mine in breakaway Chechnya on Friday, killing two people and injuring two others, a news agency said. In another mine explosion, a tractor driver was killed Thursday in the republic, the Interfax news agency reported, citing Chechnya's security officials. Chechnya's ambulance service said that three to five people are hospitalized every week with injuries from mine explosions, Interfax reported.
Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday. The videotape, shown Thursday by Chechnya's vice president, showed hostage Peter Kennedy claiming that the four men had been sent to Chechnya to listen in on phone conversations in the breakaway republic. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov will allow British government agents to come to Chechnya to investigate the killing, Atgeriyev said, according to the Interfax news agency.

Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander. But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian media reports. The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.

The European Union Wednesday condemned the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister. In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless killing of the four hostages.'' Van den Broek said the EU was determined to see remaining hostages in Chechnya released unharmed.
Chechen authorities found the decapitated heads of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday along a highway near a remote village after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern Russia. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said in Grozny that the bodies of four men had been recovered. Chechen acting First Vice Premier Turpal Atgeriyev, who is heading the investigation into the killings, said authorities had several suspects in the abduction, but have failed to make any progress, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
The government said Friday that the fighting had ended and blamed continuing violence on ethnic Albanian rebels, who are fighting for independence for the Serbian province. The Kosovo Information Center, allied with the ethnic Albanians, reported heavy fighting between government forces and the guerrillas 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said both Milosevic's government and ethnic Albanian rebels have committed atrocities since the conflict began, but the government abuses were on a much greater scale.
Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say. By putting the army back in its barracks, sending some police units out of Kosovo and ordering an end to burning and looting of villages, Milosevic may well avoid a NATO attack, diplomats here and in Washington said. But at the same time, they acknowledge that while NATO

With the threat of NATO attack mounting, Yugoslavia's prime minister warned Monday the nation faces the ``immiment danger of war'' and claimed the government was taking steps to comply with international demands for peace in Kosovo. On Sunday, Milosevic met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials.

The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. Milosevic was also told, the diplomats said, that he had to insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six months be allowed to return home. Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation 
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago. Holbrooke said he will explain the ``extreme gravity of the situation'' when he meets Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic later Monday. ``We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation,'' he said.
The United States and Russia are ratcheting up the pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, warning that NATO airstrikes are inevitable unless he takes decisive action to end the crisis in Kosovo province. Milosevic met Sunday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Yugoslavia's top defense officials. To avoid such an attack, Yugoslavia must end the hostilities, withdraw army and security forces, take urgent measures to overcome the humanitarian crisis, ensure that refugees can return home and take part in peace talks

Making their first collective decision about monetary policy, the 11 European nations launching a common currency on Jan. 1 cut interest rates Thursday in a surprise move that won market confidence. Unifying the interest rate is a critical step in laying the groundwork for monetary union, and analysts generally expected rates to settle at around the level of Germany's, 3.3 percent before the cut, now 3 percent. However, interest rate levels had become a contentious political issue with center-left governments in Germany and France pushing for rate cuts to help 
Two days before the new euro currency goes into effect for 11 European Union members, a growing number of Danes believe their country should take part, according to a poll published Tuesday. The survey by the Megaphone polling institute said 54 percent of the 1,009 people surveyed favor Denmark's participation, while 36 percent oppose that. A poll published last October showed 46 percent of Danes favored the single currency, while 44 percent were opposed.
In a surprise move, nations adopting the new European currency, the euro, dropped key interest rates Thursday, effectively setting the rate that will be adopted throughout the euro zone on Jan. 1. Setting a common interest rates had been a particularly contentious issue as center-left governments in Germany and France pressed for lower rates to help boost growth and cut unemployment, a stubborn 10.9 percent in the euro zone. ``The joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates 
Struggling to avoid being sidelined in the Continent-wide equities market promised by Europe's soon-to-be-introduced single currency, French authorities said Thursday that the Paris stock exchange would join an alliance between London and Frankfurt that is seen as the precursor of a pan-European market. And it suggested that exchange authorities in Paris, ruffled by the announcement in July of a ``strategic alliance'' between the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt, had not only abandoned an effort to set up a rival 
The annual inflation rate in the 11 nations that adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1 fell to 0.9 percent in November, the European Union's statistics agency reported Wednesday. In the 15 nation EU as a whole, inflation fell to 1 percent in November compared to 1.5 percent in the United States and 0.8 percent in Japan. Eurostat gave the following rates for November 1998, with November 1997 in brackets: Sweden, 0.1 (2.7); France, 0.2 (1.4); Germany, 0.6 (1.4)
Europe's dream of monetary union becomes reality Thursday when 11 nations irrevocably lock their currencies together to form the euro and create an economic giant whose boundaries stretch from beyond the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Mediterranean. The euro's birth is being hailed as a historic turning point in international finance and is arguably the greatest single step in the drive to create a united Europe from the ruins of World War II. On what Europeans are calling ``E-day,'' economic and finance ministers from the 11 nations will huddle 
Paradoxically, perhaps, Britain, the one major European nation that has held off from joining the euro, is widely viewed as the nerve center of the new cosmopolitanism, headquarters for the New Europeans _ bankers and business executives drawn by London's financial district, a more flexible bureaucracy and the universality of the English language. Now the European Union has a 12-year-old scholarship program, called Socrates-Erasmus, that this year allowed 200,000 European university students _ 5 percent of the EU's entire university population _ to study in 
China made trading in the euro official Monday, announcing authorization for the European common currency's use in trade and financial dealings starting Jan. 1. The expected announcement from the central People's Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, also authorized the opening of euro accounts. ``Financial institutions, enterprises and individuals in China can accept and use the euro in economic, trade and financial exchanges with 11 members of the European Union effective January 1, 1999,'' Xinhua reported
Wim Duisenberg, the head of the new European Central Bank, said in an interview published Wednesday that he won't step down after completing half his term as earlier agreed. Duisenberg was named this spring as head of the new European Central Bank, which will govern the policies of the euro, the new single currency which goes into effect Jan. 1. Although he was elected easily, Duisenberg agreed to step down after four years of his eight year term although he has since said no such ``gentleman's agreement'' exists.
In his most candid remarks yet on the economy, European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Friday that growth appears to be slowing in the 11 countries adopting the EU common currency _ or euro _ on Jan. 1. Duisenberg, who spoke at an event in London, said the Dec. 1 and Dec. 22 meetings of the Central Bank's policy-making body will gauge the outlook for inflation and the EU economy. While inflation is at its lowest levels in decades _ just 1 percent in the euro-zone _ unemployment in 
Premier Romano Prodi said Monday he would appeal directly to Parliament to save Italy's second-longest government since World War II, threatened with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. Prodi's far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation Party, provoked the crisis by withdrawing its support over the weekend and saying it would not vote for his deficit-cutting 1999 budget, which is key to Italy's participation in the European common currency. Working in Prodi's favor is the fact that few parties think they would stand to 
The latest threat to the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came after delegates to a two-day conference of the Communist Refounding Party voted to reject the government's proposed 1999 budget, imperiling the future of the center-left coalition. If the Communist Refounding's parliamentary deputies abide by the resolution, which passed by a vote of 188-112, it will destabilize Italy's government at a time when the outcome of the recent election in Germany has already injected a note of uncertainty into the future of European economic and fiscal 
By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday and was toppled from power. ``Unless the Italian political system changes, Italy is condemned to political instability,'' said Sergio Romano, a former diplomat and political science professor. The hard-line leader of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end its 28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition.
By one vote, a defector from its own ranks, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition, Italy's second-longest serving government since World War II, lost a confidence vote Friday in the Chamber of Deputies. Prodi immediately offered his resignation to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who asked him to stay on as caretaker premier while the head of state decides whether to call early elections or ask someone else to be premier.

By one vote, Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition lost a confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies Friday, and he went to the presidential palace to resign. The vote in the lower chamber of Parliament 313 against the confidence motion brought by the government to 312 in favor. The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party.
Italy's Communists on Sunday voted to withdraw support for Premier Romano Prodi's 2 1-2-year-old coalition, a move expected to trigger the collapse of one of the country's longest-lived postwar governments. Prodi had said he would call a confidence vote if the Communists yanked support. The coalition has a majority without the Communists in the Senate, but has depended on them for passage of key legislation in the Chamber.
A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil Prodi's slender majority in Parliament. ``Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists,'' said Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, a fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after they overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his resignation last year over

The swing vote came from Prodi's own coalition, a defecting deputy from Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's tiny Italian Renewal party.
Premier Romano Prodi battled Tuesday for any votes freed up from a split in a far-left party, but said he will resign if he loses a confidence vote expected later this week. Prodi's center-left government, Italy's second-longest since World War II, was threatened with collapse by the defection of its Communist ally. Prodi's is Italy's 55th government since World War II.
Three days after the collapse of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left government, Italy's president began calling in political leaders Monday to try to reach a consensus on a new government. Following the talks, which are expected to last several days, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro could ask Prodi to try again with a new majority. Prodi has said he won't take the job back unless his new government could stick to the policies of its old one, an unlikely scenario given the divided Parliament.

Microsoft, according to the people questioned by the government, would invest in Netscape, taking a 15 to 20 percent stake, give Netscape technical information 
Sponsored by Sen. John Sherman, an Ohio Republican who was the younger brother of the Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, the act was passed as a nod to a popular backlash against the rise of the industrial trusts in oil, steel and railroads. In the early 1900s, though, Standard Oil raised prices in the United States to prop up its profits at a time it was engaged in a price war against Royal Dutch/Shell in Europe, where Standard Oil did face genuine competition. When consumers were hurt by the 
The Justice Department says that the bundling of Explorer with Windows 95 and the inclusion of the browser as part of Windows 98 amount to ``tying,'' an illegal practice that forces customers of one product to purchase another. Microsoft says it needs only to show that bundling Windows and Explorer passes what might be called a ``gross'' consumer benefits test _ that it offers an immediate benefit, whether or not it causes long-term damage to competition and, therefore, ultimately to consumers. A balancing test would have the courts 
Shortly before the government filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. in May, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, met with a Silicon Valley executive. The appeals-court ruling would seem to undercut the assertion in the government's current antitrust case that the browser and the operating system were two separate products, bundled together and given away in an effort to thwart competition in the browser market. And that explains, the person continued, how it is that evidence that has been 
Soon the FTC staff opened an investigation of Microsoft and IBM And since that small first step, Microsoft has been under unrelenting scrutiny from federal antitrust investigators for a constantly evolving series of allegations and charges, month after month, year after year, for the last nine years. In 1995, Microsoft and the government reached a consent agreement in which the company promised to stop forcing PC makers to buy one copy of a Microsoft operating system for every computer sold _ instead of one for every computer on which the operating system, MS

A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days, to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial records. Microsoft had asked that the trial be delayed several more months to prepare a defense against what it said was a last minute broadening of the case by the Justice Department, which had added new evidence. To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday, Robert Muglia, a senior Microsoft executive 
Microsoft officials are closely watching market surveys for any hint that the new image of a bare-knuckled Gates might be detracting from the company's world-famous brand name, but they insist that the public will continue to draw a distinction between allegations of anticompetitive business tactics and the company's software. One showed him holding a globe and saying, ``If you don't play my way, I'll take my ball and go home''; another portrayed the Microsoft chairman standing next to a henchman dangling someone from a window 
Greek media and officials leveled strong opposition Sunday to the possible extradition of Abdullah Ocalan, the arrested Kurdish guerrilla leader, to Greece's traditional rival Turkey. Ocalan, whose Kurdistan Workers Party has waged a 14-year war with Turkey for autonomy in southeastern Turkey, is in prison custody in Rome where his arrest was announced Friday. Greece's Communist party and a small leftist opposition party called on the government to exercise its influence on Italy to keep Ocalan there.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to ``opening doors to terrorism.'' If Italy sends Ocalan back to Turkey, ``he'll be tortured for certain,'' said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. ``If Italy continues to show the tolerance it showed yesterday, it will be opening its doors to terrorism,'' Ecevit added, referring to Italy's handling of brawls

About 1,000 policemen were assigned to protect Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, who arrived Tuesday on a three-day official visit. President Thomas Klestil's invitation for the visit was issued to take place during Austria's European Union presidency. Following his talks with Klestil and a luncheon in the president's residence, Demirel was scheduled to meet Parliament president Heinz Fischer and other senior officials.
Turkey wants Italy to extradite the rebel, Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is seeking Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey. D'Alema said a committee in the Interior Ministry would determine whether Ocalan would qualify for political asylum, which would be possible if Ocalan's promise to renounce terrorism, issued Monday, holds up. D'Alema's decision was further complicated on Sunday when Turkish inmates in a prison in Istanbul took an Italian prisoner hostage, saying they would release him only after Italy extradited Ocalan.
Turkish newspapers have carried frequent reports of power struggles within the PKK and said that Ocalan's grip on the PKK was beginning to waver. His presence in Europe could also be a blessing in disguise for the group, forcing the PKK to transform itself from a rebel army into a political movement. The rebels also seem to have lost the support of Syria, which appears to have forced Ocalan to leave after Turkey threatened to attack it.
INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials said Monday. Most of those sent back since the crackdown began Saturday were refused entry into Italy because they had no visas or residence permits, the Austrians said. Austrian authorities said many of those turned back had come from Germany.
Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Kurdish business leaders said the one-day shutdown Monday cost their 1,000 businesses some dlrs 700,000, daily Evenimentul Zilei reported. The detention in Italy of Kurdish rebel leader Ocalan prompted widespread protests by Kurds throughout Europe.
Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said. The Italian, Mario Calascibetta, was taken hostage Sunday by a group of inmates affiliated with mob leader Yasar Oz, to push for the return to Turkey of rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey's most-wanted man. Turkey's Anatolia news agency said Oz was determined not to free his hostage until Italy agreed to Turkey's demand 
About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention. Kurds from across Western Europe have been streaming into Rome to show their support for Ocalan (pronounced Oh-jah-lan), who was arrested Thursday when he stepped off a plane from Moscow. He had been seeking political asylum in Russia after fleeing his hideout in Syria.
Hours before China was expected to sign a key U.N. human rights treaty and host British Prime Minister Tony Blair, police hauled a prominent human rights campaigner in for questioning Monday. Qin hoped the harassment would stop after China signs the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but he said if local authorities don't observe the treaty ``we will unswervingly push ahead with protecting human rights to the last.'' Thousands of political prisoners are believed to remain in Chinese prisons, labor camps or detention centers, said the letter, a 
The sudden arrest on Monday night of Xu, as well as several other activists involved with him in trying to form the China Democratic Party, set off strong protests from human rights groups, other Chinese dissidents and Washington. Dissidents in and out of China rose to Xu's defense, with more than a dozen activists around the country announcing that they would begin fasts in support of Xu and another leader of the China Democratic Party, Qin Yongmin, who was arrested in his home in Wuhan on Monday. In the Chinese criminal 
The dissident, Yao Zhenxian, who was released in April from a Chinese labor camp, is a leader of the China Democracy Party, which was formed in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Beatrice Laroche, liaison at the United Nations for Human Rights in China, a New York-based group, said the China Democracy Party was a growing presence in some of China's most populous provinces, including Sichuan. Ms. Laroche said the Yao brothers, especially the younger man, won prominence by helping to finance predecessors 
Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among the most active and influential members of China's dissident community. Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for fair trials, the Information Center said. Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996.
Police detained and questioned the organizer of a group set up by dissidents to monitor official corruption and told him the group's activities must cease, a human rights group said Thursday. Police in Xinyang, in central China's Henan province, took An Jun away Wednesday afternoon and held him until past midnight for questioning about the group's members, said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China. The police officers who questioned An Jun said that without official permission, the group must cease its activities, the center 
The defendant is Qin Yongmin, 45, a democracy advocate who has spent 10 years in prison and labor camps and has recently promoted an alternative, non-Communist political party. As the founder of the suppressed new political party, the China Democracy Party, he publicly announced its charter in June during President Clinton's visit to China. Scores of people around the country began to champion the new party, hopeful that closer ties between China and the United States, and China's signing of the international covenant on political and civil 
China's government said Thursday that two prominent dissidents arrested this week are suspected of endangering national security _ the clearest sign yet Chinese leaders plan to quash a would-be opposition party. A third leading advocate of the China Democracy Party who has been in custody for a month, Wang Youcai, was accused of ``inciting the overthrow of the government,'' the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported. The arrests of Xu and Qin at their homes Monday night and the accusations against 
China's central government ordered the arrest of a prominent democracy campaigner and may use his contacts with exiled Chinese dissidents to charge him with harming national security, a colleague said Wednesday. Xu and another influential dissident, Qin Yongmin, were arrested Monday night in police raids in two cities that delivered the sternest blow so far to a five-month campaign to establish the China Democracy Party and challenge the ruling Communist Party's monopoly on power. Zha, who helped Xu organize would-be party members in Beijing and the nearby port 
One leader of a suppressed new political party will be tried on Dec. 17 on a charge of colluding with foreign enemies of China ``to incite the subversion of state power,'' according to court documents given to his wife on Monday. The decision to try the leader, Wang Youcai, a founder of the China Democracy Party, with unusual speed suggests how serious the Communist authorities are in their campaign to destroy the fledgling party and silence dissidents who had begun to speak out over the last year. In addition to detailing Wang
The separate trials of two prominent democracy advocates for inciting subversion of the state opened Thursday morning, with the families of both defendants protesting their inability to hire defense lawyers. The trial in the eastern city of Hangzhou of Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which is now suppressed, was in session for just two hours and 10 minutes. Since all the lawyers his family approached were intimidated by security agents, Ms. Hu said, Wang tried to mount his own defense Thursday morning after prosecutors laid out their 
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 155. Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the upper floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation. ``The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' said Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case.
A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city. Police earlier had reported 65 dead, but backed off that figure Friday evening. ''The earlier information that police gave out was wrong,'' Hans Carlsson, the lead detective in the case, told a news conference.
Forensic experts examining heavily burned bodies were able Saturday to identify more of the 60 young people who died in a dance hall fire, but the catastrophe's most tormenting question was still unanswered. How could it happen; what caused the flames that raced through a hall packed far beyond capacity, blocking one of the exits and forcing panicked teen-agers to flee down the one remaining staircase and leap out of second-story windows? The first call alerting authorities to the fire was made in heavily accented Swedish and that, combined 
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Hans Carlsson, the detective leading the disaster investigation. At a news conference Friday morning, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths 
A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday. The first fire trucks and rescue squads were on the scene six minutes after the call was received, Ortarsen said at a news conference. The fire's quick spread has prompted speculation that it could have been set, but officials also say the explosive spread could have been because 
Although an estimated 400 people, most aged 13 to 18, were at the dance on the building's second floor, the facility had approval for a maximum capacity of 150, said Carlsson. The Macedonian Association, which rents space in the building, had in turn rented the facility out to others for the dance, Carlsson said. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help

The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas. On Friday, police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene, and the 60th victim died at a hospital, officials said. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling with police to 
``It reminded me of the gas chambers at Auschwitz,'' local rescue service leader Lennart Olin said on national radio, describing the sight when rescuers first entered the building in Goteborg, a city of half a million people on the country's west coast. ``It was a panic,'' Goteborg police spokesman Bengt Staaf said, with youths trampling each other to get out, and other youths scuffling with police to get in and attempt to help friends. Olin said the rescue service inspected the building in April 1997 and ``
Hundreds of teen-agers jammed into an upstairs hall planning to dance the night away, but by the time the sun rose Friday they were dead, clinging to life in hospitals or weeping in disbelief at a fire that killed 67 of them. Police said another 173 people were injured, 20 of them severely, in the explosive fire that engulfed the plain brick two-story building just before midnight Thursday and turned a boisterous disco dance into a screaming terror in a matter of moments.

Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute, which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday hat Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. Moussa said Mubarak had consulted by phone on Saturday with Assad and also conveyed a message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel through Turkey's ambassador to Egypt, Yasser Yakis. For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Signaling it does not want to be involved in any potential military confrontation between Syria and Turkey, Israel is limiting routine exercises along its own border with Syria. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai instructed the army to limit military maneuvers along Israel's border with Syria to avoid giving any impression Israel is poised to act. ``Israel is not interested in confrontation with Syria, but rather in finding ways to renew talks,'' Mordechai's office quoted him Sunday as saying.
Iran has offered to mediate between Syria and Turkey in the deepening dispute over Kurdish rebel bases and plans to dispatch envoys to the two countries, the Tehran Times reported Monday. Turkey long has accused Syria of providing refuge to Kurdish rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey. For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.

For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Greece on Monday warned that mounting tension between Turkey and Syria could lead to ``tragic results'' if not dealt with in its early stages. Greece accused Turkey of undermining the whole region's stability through its stand-off with Syria over the alleged harboring of Kurdish rebels. In the past, Turkish officials have also accused Greece of harboring Kurdish rebels and running guerrilla training camps.
As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria. Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria. Damascus is concerned by Ankara's plans to build dams on the Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria, while Turkey accuses Syria of having aspirations over a Turkish border province, Hatay, which has a 
Turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its southeastern border with Syria amid growing tensions between the two neighbors, newspapers reported Thursday. The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer (375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops were being deployed. Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; it says rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus.
After trekking several hundred kilometers (miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers (11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives. If the rebels succeed in capturing Kindu, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel headquarters, this will remove the last government stronghold in eastern Congo and pave the way for rebel advance into the mineral-rich southwest. ``Our soldiers are in the town 
Rebels attacked a village in western Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off, a military spokesman said Thursday. The anti-Kabila rebels claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army, which operates in northern Uganda and enjoys support from Sudan, is fighting alongside Kabila's forces together with Sudanese soldiers. New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for Security Muruli Mukasa as saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain, 38 kilometers (24 miles) south of Juba, was destroyed last week when the SPLA took control
The bloody bandages of injured rebels trucked back to this rear base Wednesday offered evidence that the three-day battle for the strategic air base at Kindu was not going well for those fighting to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. It was impossible to say who had the upper hand in the battle for Kindu and its air base, which government forces have been using to launch airstrikes on eastern towns and to assemble ground troops. On Wednesday, a truck unloaded a dozen wounded rebel fighters at Kalima, a small town 80 kilometers (
Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. ``We have to explain to the world audience who we are and what we're fighting for,'' rebel leader Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said on Friday. The rebels are a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's army and political opponents who accuse Kabila of power-grabbing, mismanagement, corruption and sowing dissent among Congo's 400 tribes.

After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances. Etienne Ngangura, a rebel spokesman, said the rebel fighters were inside Kindu and had taken the adjacent, large airbase, 380 kilometers (235 miles) west of Goma, the rebel stronghold. Apart from Kindu, Ngangura said rebel fighters took Buta, 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Kisangani and on the main road in northern Congo that links Sudan 
Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into a strategic airport facing a rebel assault. He said the plane was shot down while approaching Kindu air base, where the rebels had deployed at least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final assault on the government-held town. Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima, that fighters 
A day after shooting down a jetliner carrying 40 people, rebels clashed with government troops near a strategic airstrip in eastern Congo on Sunday. Kabangu Kalunga said 3,500 rebel troops and their Rwandan allies had closed in on government forces from three directions after a week of fighting. Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away. Rebel commander Fino Kabangu Kalunga said the government forces, surrounded by 3,500 rebel troops from three directions, failed to respond to Sunday's attacks. On Saturday, the rebels said they shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 which was attempting to land at Kindu air base with 40 troops and ammunition
Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of cattle here, slashed coffee and tea exports in half and turned Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pastures, sparkling volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into a war zone. In 1990, the liberating effect of early political freedoms revived unresolved land disputes and led to clashes between the Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus _ who had settled in eastern Congo since the 1930s. In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis 
The international space station is a U.S.-led successor to Russia's Mir space station, and is being heralded by space officials as the vehicle for unprecedented international cooperation in space in the 21st century. The heads of the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan and Canada, along with the European Space Agency, met in Moscow on Saturday to discuss the project, the Interfax news agency reported. Also Saturday, the head of Russia's Mission Control, Vladimir Lobachev, was quoted as saying that Russia would take 
A Russian Proton booster rocket carried the first part of the international space station into orbit Friday, heralding the start of a new era in international space colonization. ``Now we only have 44 launches to go, about 1,000 hours of space walks and countless problems, but because of the trust and mutual respect ... the international space station is going to be a reality,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin told a press conference after the launch. The launch of the first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because the chronically broke Russian space 
WASHINGTON _ NASA and the Russian Space Agency have agreed to set aside a last-minute Russian request to launch an international space station into an orbit closer to Mir, officials announced Friday. While putting the new station closer to Russia's 12-year-old Mir station would make it easier to transfer equipment and supplies from the old outpost to the new one, the request came too late to be acted on, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager. NASA will consider ideas for salvaging Mir's research equipment to 
Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together.
The first part of the international space station was smoothly orbiting Earth on Friday after a faultless launch that marked the start of a new age in space exploration and colonization. Russia's Zarya, or Sunrise, module is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module. Space officials from 16 nations taking part in the project cheered as the rocket soared into the cloudy sky above the central Asian steppe from the Baikonur launch pad Friday 
The planned seven-hour spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or crucial as Monday night's outing, during which Ross and Newman hooked up 40 electrical connections between Zarya and Unity. Mission Control decided just before the spacewalk to let Newman take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna. One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Russian space experts were making final preparations Thursday at the Baikonur rocket base to launch the first component of a multibillion dollar international space station after a year of delay. Agency chief Yuri Koptev said that taking part in the new station is the only hope for the beleaguered Russian space industry, whose funding has collapsed since the Soviet collapse. Koptev assailed some Russian space engineers who continue to insist that more money should be put into Russia's own battered 12-year old Mir space station to extend its lifetime instead of committing more funds to the 
James Van Laak, NASA's deputy manager of operations for the space station, said Friday that the agency had not received any formal proposals about extending Mir's life. ``NASA would find such a proposal unacceptable if it has any measurable impact on the international space station,'' Van Laak said in a telephone interview from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, ``No one has any objection to Mir or keeping it operational if the Russians find a way to support both projects, but they have to demonstrate they can.'' 
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris. In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.
